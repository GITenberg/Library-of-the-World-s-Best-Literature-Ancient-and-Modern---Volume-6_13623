<h2>THE ABB&Eacute; DE BRANT&Ocirc;ME (PIERRE DE BOURDEILLE)</h2>
<h3>(1527-1614)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-e.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>very historian of the Valois period is indebted to
Brant&ocirc;me for preserving the atmosphere and detail of the
brilliant life in which he moved as a dashing courtier, a military
adventurer, and a gallant gentleman of high degree. He was not a
professional scribe, nor a student; but he took notes
unconsciously, and in the evening of his life turned back the pages
of his memory to record the scenes through which he had passed and
the characters which he had known. He has been termed the "valet de
chambre" of history; nevertheless the anecdotes scattered through
his works will ever be treasured by all students and historians of
that age of luxury and magnificence, art and beauty, beneath which
lay the fermentation of great religious and political movements,
culminating in the struggle between the Huguenots and
Catholics.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/brantome.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Abb&eacute; De Brant&ocirc;me</b></p>
<p>Brant&ocirc;me was the third son of the Vicomte de Bourdeille, a
P&eacute;rigord nobleman, whose family had lived long in Guienne,
and whose aristocratic lineage was lost in myth. Upon the estate
stood the Abbey of Brant&ocirc;me, founded by Charlemagne, and this
Henry II. gave to young Pierre de Bourdeille in recognition of the
military deeds of his brother, Jean de Bourdeille, who lost his
life in service. Thereafter the lad was to sign his name as the
Reverend Father in God, Messire Pierre de Bourdeille, Abb&eacute;
de Brant&ocirc;me. Born in the old ch&acirc;teau in 1527, he was
destined for the church, but abandoned this career for arms. At an
early age he was sent to court as page to Marguerite, sister of
Francis I. and Queen of Navarre; after her death in 1549, he went
to Paris to study at the University. His title of Abb&eacute; being
merely honorary, he served in the army under Fran&ccedil;ois de
Guise, Duke of Lorraine, and became Gentleman of the Chamber to
Charles IX. His career extended through the reigns of Henry II.,
Francis II., Charles IX., Henry III., and Henry IV., to that of
Louis XIII. With the exception of diplomatic missions, service on
the battle-field, and voyages for pleasure, he spent his life at
court.</p>
<p>About 1594 he retired to his estate, where until his death on
July 15th, 1614, he passed his days in contentions with the monks
of Brant&ocirc;me, in lawsuits with his neighbors, and in writing
his books: 'Lives of the Illustrious Men and Great Captains of
France'; 'Lives of Illustrious Ladies'; 'Lives of Women of
Gallantry'; 'Memoirs, containing anecdotes connected with the Court
of France'; 'Spanish Rodomontades'; a 'Life' of his father,
Fran&ccedil;ois de Bourdeille; a 'Funeral Oration' on his sister
in-law; and a dialogue in verse, entitled 'The Tomb of Madame de
Bourdeille.' These were not published until long after his death,
first appearing in Leyden about 1665, at the Hague in 1740, and in
Paris in 1787. The best editions are by Fourcault (7 vols., Paris,
1822); by Lacour and M&eacute;rim&eacute;e (3 vols., 1859); and
Lalande (10 vols., 1865-'81).</p>
<p>What Brant&ocirc;me thought of himself may be seen by glancing
at that portion of the "testament mystique" which relates to his
writings:--</p>
<blockquote>"I will and expressly charge my heirs that they cause
to be printed the books which I have composed by my talent and
invention. These books will be found covered with velvet, either
black, green or blue, and one larger volume, which is that of the
Rodomontades, covered with velvet, gilt outside and curiously
bound. All have been carefully corrected. There will be found in
these books excellent things, such as stories, histories,
discourses, and witty sayings, which I flatter myself the world
will not disdain to read when once it has had a sight of them. I
direct that a sum of money be taken from my estate sufficient to
pay for the printing thereof, which certainly cannot be much; for I
have known many printers who would have given money rather than
charged any for the right of printing them. They print many things
without charge which are not at all equal to mine. I will also that
the said impression shall be in large type, in order to make the
better appearance, and that they should appear with the Royal
Privilege, which the King will readily grant. Also care must be
taken that the printers do not put on the title-page any
supposititious name instead of mine. Otherwise, I should be
defrauded of the glory which is my due."</blockquote>
<p>The old man delighted in complimenting himself and talking about
his "grandeur d'&acirc;me." This greatness of soul may be measured
from the command he gave his heirs to annoy a man who had refused
to swear homage to him, "it not being reasonable to leave at rest
this little wretch, who descends from a low family, and whose
grandfather was nothing but a notary." He also commands his nieces
and nephews to take the same vengeance upon his enemies "as I
should have done in my green and vigorous youth, during which I may
boast, and I thank God for it, that I never received an injury
without being revenged on the author of it."</p>
<p>Brant&ocirc;me writes like a "gentleman of the sword," with dash
and <i>&eacute;lan</i>, and as one, to use his own words, who has
been "toujours trottant, traversant, et vagabondant le monde"
(always trotting, traversing, and tramping the world). Not in the
habit of a vagabond, however, for the balls, banquets, tournaments,
masques, ballets, and wedding-feasts which he describes so vividly
were occasions for the display of sumptuous costumes; and Messire
Pierre de Bourdeille doubtless appeared as elegant as any other
gallant in silken hose, jeweled doublet, flowing cape, and long
rapier. What we value most are his paintings of these festive
scenes, and the vivid portraits which he has left of the Valois
women, who were largely responsible for the luxuries and the crimes
of the period: women who could step without a tremor from a
court-masque to a massacre; who could toy with a gallant's ribbons
and direct the blow of an assassin; and who could poison a rival
with a delicately perfumed gift. Such a court Brant&ocirc;me calls
the "true paradise of the world, school of all honesty and virtue,
ornament of France." We like to hear about Catherine de' Medici
riding with her famous "squadron of Venus": "You should have seen
forty or fifty dames and demoiselles following her, mounted on
beautifully accoutred hackneys, their hats adorned with feathers
which increased their charm, so well did the flying plumes
represent the demand for love or war. Virgil, who undertook to
describe the fine apparel of Queen Dido when she went out hunting,
has by no means equaled that of our Queen and her ladies."</p>
<p>Charming, too, are such descriptions as "the most beautiful
ballet that ever was, composed of sixteen of the fairest and
best-trained dames and demoiselles, who appeared in a silvered rock
where they were seated in niches, shut in on every side. The
sixteen ladies represented the sixteen provinces of France. After
having made the round of the hall for parade as in a camp, they all
descended, and ranging themselves in the form of a little oddly
contrived battalion, some thirty violins began a very pleasant
warlike air, to which they danced their ballet." After an hour the
ladies presented the King, the Queen-Mother, and others with golden
plaques, on which were engraved "the fruits and singularities of
each province," the wheat of Champagne, the vines of Burgundy, the
lemons and oranges of Provence, etc. He shows us Catherine de'
Medici, the elegant, cunning Florentine; her beautiful daughters,
Elizabeth of Spain and Marguerite de Valois; Diana of Poitiers, the
woman of eternal youth and beauty; Jeanne d'Albret, the mother of
Henry IV.; Louise de Vaudemont; the Duchesse d'&Eacute;tampes;
Marie Touchet; and all their satellites,--as they enjoyed their
lives.</p>
<p>Very valuable are the data regarding Mary Stuart's departure
from France in 1561. Brant&ocirc;me was one of her suite, and
describes her grief when the shores of France faded away, and her
arrival in Scotland, where on the first night she was serenaded by
Psalm-tunes with a most villainous accompaniment of Scotch music.
"H&eacute;! quelle musique!" he exclaims, "et quel repos pour la
nuit!"</p>
<p>But of all the gay ladies Brant&ocirc;me loves to dwell upon,
his favorites are the two Marguerites: Marguerite of
Angoul&ecirc;me, Queen of Navarre, the sister of Francis I., and
Marguerite, daughter of Catherine de' Medici and wife of Henry IV.
Of the latter, called familiarly "La Reine Margot," he is always
writing. "To speak of the beauty of this rare princess," he says,
"I think that all that are, or will be, or have ever been near her
are ugly."</p>
<p>Brant&ocirc;me has been a puzzle to many critics, who cannot
explain his "contradictions." He had none. He extolled wicked and
immoral characters because he recognized only two
merits,--aristocratic birth and hatred of the Huguenots. He is well
described by M. de Barante, who says:--"Brant&ocirc;me expresses
the entire character of his country and of his profession. Careless
of the difference between good and evil; a courtier who has no idea
that anything can be blameworthy in the great, but who sees and
narrates their vices and their crimes all the more frankly in that
he is not very sure whether what he tells be good or bad; as
indifferent to the honor of women as he is to the morality of men;
relating scandalous things with no consciousness that they are
such, and almost leading his reader into accepting them as the
simplest things in the world, so little importance does he attach
to them; terming Louis XI., who poisoned his brother, the
<i>good</i> King Louis, calling women whose adventures could hardly
have been written by any pen save his own, <i>honn&ecirc;tes
dames</i>."</p>
<p>Brant&ocirc;me must therefore not be regarded as a chronicler
who revels in scandals, although his pages reek with them; but as
the true mirror of the Valois court and the Valois period.</p>

<h3>THE DANCING OF ROYALTY</h3>
<center>From 'Lives of Notable Women'</center>
<br>
<p>Ah! how the times have changed since I saw them together in the
ball-room, expressing the very spirit of the dance! The King always
opened the grand ball by leading out his sister, and each equaled
the other in majesty and grace. I have often seen them dancing the
Pavane d'Espagne, which must be performed with the utmost majesty
and grace. The eyes of the entire court were riveted upon them,
ravished by this lovely scene; for the measures were so well
danced, the steps so intelligently placed, the sudden pauses timed
so accurately and making so elegant an effect, that one did not
know what to admire most,--the beautiful manner of moving, or the
majesty of the halts, now expressing excessive gayety, now a
beautiful and haughty disdain. Who could dance with such elegance
and grace as the royal brother and sister? None, I believe; and I
have watched the King dancing with the Queen of Spain and the Queen
of Scotland, each of whom was an excellent dancer.</p>
<p>I have seen them dance the 'Pazzemezzo d'Italie,' walking
gravely through the measures, and directing their steps with so
graceful and solemn a manner that no other prince nor lady could
approach them in dignity. This Queen took great pleasure in
performing these grave dances; for she preferred to exhibit
dignified grace rather than to express the gayety of the Branle,
the Volta, and the Courante. Although she acquired them quickly,
she did not think them worthy of her majesty.</p>
<p>I always enjoyed seeing her dance the Branle de la Torche, or du
Flambeau. Once, returning from the nuptials of the daughter of the
King of Poland, I saw her dance this kind of a Branle at Lyons
before the assembled guests from Savoy, Piedmont, Italy, and other
places; and every one said he had never seen any sight more
captivating than this lovely lady moving with grace of motion and
majestic mien, all agreeing that she had no need of the flaming
torch which she held in her hand; for the flashing light from her
brilliant eyes was sufficient to illuminate the set, and to pierce
the dark veil of Night.</p>

<h3>THE SHADOW OF A TOMB</h3>
<center>From 'Lives of Courtly Women'</center>
<br>
<p>Once I had an elder brother who was called Captain Bourdeille,
one of the bravest and most valiant soldiers of his time. Although
he was my brother, I must praise him, for the record he made in the
wars brought him fame. He was the <i>gentilhomme de France</i> who
stood first in the science and gallantry of arms. He was killed
during the last siege of Hesdin. My brother's parents had destined
him for the career of letters, and accordingly sent him at the age
of eighteen to study in Italy, where he settled in Ferrara because
of Madame Ren&eacute;e de France, Duchess of Ferrara, who ardently
loved my mother. He enjoyed life at her court, and soon fell deeply
in love with a young French widow,--Mademoiselle de La Roche,--who
was in the suite of Madame de Ferrara.</p>
<p>They remained there in the service of love, until my father,
seeing that his son was not following literature, ordered him home.
She, who loved him, begged him to take her with him to France and
to the court of Marguerite of Navarre, whom she had served, and who
had given her to Madame Ren&eacute;e when she went to Italy upon
her marriage. My brother, who was young, was greatly charmed to
have her companionship, and conducted her to Pau. The Queen was
glad to welcome her, for the young widow was handsome and
accomplished, and indeed considered superior in <i>esprit</i> to
the other ladies of the court.</p>
<p>After remaining a few days with my mother and grandmother, who
were there, my brother visited his father. In a short time he
declared that he was disgusted with letters, and joined the army,
serving in the wars of Piedmont and Parma, where he acquired much
honor in the space of five or six months; during which time he did
not revisit his home. At the end of this period he went to see his
mother at Pau. He made his reverence to the Queen of Navarre as she
returned from vespers; and she, who was the best princess in the
world, received him cordially, and taking his hand, led him about
the church for an hour or two. She demanded news regarding the wars
of Piedmont and Italy, and many other particulars, to which my
brother replied so well that she was greatly pleased with him. He
was a very handsome young man of twenty-four years. After talking
gravely and engaging him in earnest conversation, walking up and
down the church, she directed her steps toward the tomb of
Mademoiselle de La Roche, who had been dead for three months. She
stopped here, and again took his hand, saying, "My cousin" (thus
addressing him because a daughter of D'Albret was married into our
family of Bourdeille; but of this I do not boast, for it has not
helped me particularly), "do you not feel something move below your
feet?"</p>
<p>"No, Madame," he replied.</p>
<p>"But reflect again, my cousin," she insisted.</p>
<p>My brother answered, "Madame, I feel nothing move. I stand upon
a solid stone."</p>
<p>"Then I will explain," said the Queen, "without keeping you
longer in suspense, that you stand upon the tomb and over the body
of your poor dearly-loved Mademoiselle de La Roche, who is interred
here; and that our friends may have sentiment for us at our death,
render a pious homage here. You cannot doubt that the gentle
creature, dying so recently, must have been affected when you
approached. In remembrance I beg you to say a paternoster and an
Ave Maria and a de profundis, and sprinkle holy water. Thus you
will win the name of a very faithful lover and a good
Christian."</p>

<h3>M. LE CONSTABLE ANNE DE MONTMORENCY</h3>
<center>From 'Lives of Distinguished Men and Great
Captains'</center>
<br>
<p>He never failed to say and keep up his paternosters every
morning, whether he remained in the house, or mounted his horse and
went out to the field to join the army. It was a common saying
among the soldiers that one must "beware the paternosters of the
Constable." For as disorders were very frequent, he would say,
while mumbling and muttering his paternosters all the time, "Go and
fetch that fellow and hang me him up to this tree;" "Out with a
file of harquebusiers here before me this instant, for the
execution of this man!" "Burn me this village instantly!" "Cut me
to pieces at once all these villain peasants, who have dared to
hold this church against the king!" All this without ever ceasing
from his paternosters till he had finished them--thinking that he
would have done very wrong to put them off to another time; so
conscientious was he!</p>

<h3>TWO FAMOUS ENTERTAINMENTS</h3>
<center>From 'Lives of Courtly Women'</center>
<br>
<p>I have read in a Spanish book called 'El Viaje del Principe'
(The Voyage of the Prince), made by the King of Spain in the
Pays-Bas in the time of the Emperor Charles, his father, about the
wonderful entertainments given in the rich cities. The most famous
was that of the Queen of Hungary in the lovely town of Bains, which
passed into a proverb, "Mas bravas que las festas de Bains" (more
magnificent than the festivals of Bains). Among the displays which
were seen during the siege of a counterfeit castle, she ordered for
one day a f&ecirc;te in honor of the Emperor her brother, Queen
Eleanor her sister, and the gentlemen and ladies of the court.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the feast a lady appeared with six
Oread-nymphs, dressed as huntresses in classic costumes of silver
and green, glittering with jewels to imitate the light of the moon.
Each one carried a bow and arrows in her hand and wore a quiver on
her shoulder; their buskins were of cloth of silver. They entered
the hall, leading their dogs after them, and placed on the table in
front of the Emperor all kinds of venison pasties, supposed to have
been the spoils of the chase. After them came the Goddess of
Shepherds and her six nymphs, dressed in cloth of silver, garnished
with pearls. They wore knee-breeches beneath their flowing robes,
and white pumps, and brought in various products of the dairy.</p>
<p>Then entered the third division--Pomona and her nymphs--bearing
fruit of all descriptions. This goddess was the daughter of Donna
Beatrix Pacheco, Countess d'Autremont, lady-in-waiting to Queen
Eleanor, and was but nine years old. She was now Madame l'Admirale
de Chastillon, whom the Admiral married for his second wife.
Approaching with her companions, she presented her gifts to the
Emperor with an eloquent speech, delivered so beautifully that she
received the admiration of the entire assembly, and all predicted
that she would become a beautiful, charming, graceful, and
captivating lady. She was dressed in cloth of silver and white,
with white buskins, and a profusion of precious stones--emeralds,
colored like some of the fruit she bore. After making these
presentations, she gave the Emperor a Palm of Victory, made of
green enamel, the fronds tipped with pearls and jewels. This was
very rich and gorgeous. To Queen Eleanor she gave a fan containing
a mirror set with gems of great value. Indeed, the Queen of Hungary
showed that she was a very excellent lady, and the Emperor was
proud of a sister worthy of himself. All the young ladies who
impersonated these mythical characters were selected from the
suites of France, Hungary, and Madame de Lorraine; and were
therefore French, Italian, Flemish, German, and of Lorraine. None
of them lacked beauty.</p>
<p>At the same time that these f&ecirc;tes were taking place at
Bains, Henry II. made his entr&eacute;e in Piedmont and at his
garrisons in Lyons, where were assembled the most brilliant of his
courtiers and court ladies. If the representation of Diana and her
chase given by the Queen of Hungary was found beautiful, the one at
Lyons was more beautiful and complete. As the king entered the
city, he saw obelisks of antiquity to the right and left, and a
wall of six feet was constructed along the road to the courtyard,
which was filled with underbrush and planted thickly with trees and
shrubbery. In this miniature forest were hidden deer and other
animals.</p>
<p>As soon as his Majesty approached, to the sound of horns and
trumpets Diana issued forth with her companions, dressed in the
fashion of a classic nymph with her quiver at her side and her bow
in her hand. Her figure was draped in black and gold sprinkled with
silver stars, the sleeves were of crimson satin bordered with gold,
and the garment, looped up above the knee, revealed her buskins of
crimson satin covered with pearls and embroidery. Her hair was
entwined with magnificent strings of rich pearls and gems of much
value, and above her brow was placed a crescent of silver,
surrounded by little diamonds. Gold could never have suggested half
so well as the shining silver the white light of the real crescent.
Her companions were attired in classic costumes made of taffetas of
various colors, shot with gold, and their ringlets were adorned
with all kinds of glittering gems....</p>
<p>Other nymphs carried darts of Brazil-wood tipped with black and
white tassels, and carried horns and trumpets suspended by ribbons
of white and black. When the King appeared, a lion, which had long
been under training, ran from the wood and lay at the feet of the
Goddess, who bound him with a leash of white and black and led him
to the king, accompanying her action with a poem of ten verses,
which she delivered most beautifully. Like the lion--so ran the
lines--the city of Lyons lay at his Majesty's feet, gentle,
gracious, and obedient to his command. This spoken, Diana and her
nymphs made low bows and retired.</p>
<p>Note that Diana and her companions were married women, widows,
and young girls, taken from the best society in Lyons, and there
was no fault to be found with the way they performed their parts.
The King, the princes, and the ladies and gentlemen of the court
were ravished. Madame de Valentinois, called Diana of
Poitiers,--whom the King served and in whose name the mock chase
was arranged,--was not less content.</p>

<h2>FREDRIKA BREMER</h2>
<h3>(1801-1865)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-f.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>redrika Bremer was born at Tuorla Manor-house, near &Aring;bo,
in Finland, on the 17th of August, 1801. In 1804 the family removed
to Stockholm, and two years later to a large estate at &Aring;rsta,
some twenty miles from the capital, which was her subsequent home.
At &Aring;rsta the father of Fredrika, who had amassed a fortune in
the iron industry in Finland, set up an establishment in accord
with his means. The manor-house, built two centuries before, had
become in some parts dilapidated, but it was ultimately restored
and improved beyond its original condition. From its windows on one
side the eye stretched over nearly five miles of meadows, fields,
and villages belonging to the estate.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/bremer.jpg" width="45%" alt=""><br>
<b>Fredrika Bremer</b></p>
<p>In spite of its surroundings, however, Fredrika's childhood was
not a happy one. Her mother was severe and impatient of petty
faults, and the child's mind became embittered. Her father was
reserved and melancholy. Fredrika herself was restless and
passionate, although of an affectionate nature. Among the other
children she was the ugly duckling, who was misunderstood, and
whose natural development was continually checked and frustrated.
Her talents were early exhibited in a variety of directions. Her
first verses, in French, to the morn, were written at the age of
eight. Subsequently she wrote comedies for home production, prose
and verse of all sorts, and kept a journal, which has been
preserved. In 1821 the whole family went on a tour abroad, from
which they did not return until the following year, having visited
in the meantime Germany, Switzerland, and France, and spent the
winter in Paris. This year among new scenes and surroundings seems
to have brought home to Fredrika, upon the resumption of her old
life in the country, its narrowness and its isolation. She was
entirely shut off from all desired activity; her illusions vanished
one by one. "I was conscious," she says in her short autobiography,
"of being born with powerful wings, but I was conscious of their
being clipped;" and she fancied that they would remain so.</p>
<p>Her attention, however, was fortunately attracted from herself
to the poor and sick in the country round about; and she presently
became to the whole region a nurse and a helper, denying herself
all sorts of comforts that she might give them to others, and
braving storm and hunger on her errands of mercy. In order to earn
money for her charities she painted miniature portraits of the
Crown Princess and the King, and secretly sold them. Her desire to
increase the small sums she thus gained induced her to seek a
publisher for a number of sketches she had written. Her brother
readily disposed of the manuscript for a hundred rix-dollars; and
her first book, 'Teckningar ur Hvardagslifvet' (Sketches of
Every-day Life), appeared in 1828, but without the name of the
author, of whose identity the publisher himself was left in
ignorance. The book was received with such favor that the young
author was induced to try again; and what had originally been
intended as a second volume of the 'Sketches' appeared in 1830 as
'Familjen H.' (The H. Family). Its success was immediate and
unmistakable. It not only was received with applause, but created a
sensation, and Swedish literature was congratulated on the
acquisition of a new talent among its writers.</p>
<p>The secret of Fredrika's authorship--which had as yet not been
confided even to her parents--was presently revealed to the poet
(and later bishop) Franz&eacute;n, an old friend of the family.
Shortly afterward the Swedish Academy, of which Franz&eacute;n was
secretary, awarded her its lesser gold medal as a sign of
appreciation. A third volume met with even greater success than its
predecessors, and seemed definitely to point out the career which
she subsequently followed; and from this time until the close of
her life she worked diligently in her chosen field. She rapidly
acquired an appreciative public in and out of Sweden. Many of her
novels and tales were translated into various languages, several of
them appearing simultaneously in Swedish and English. In 1844 the
Swedish Academy awarded her its great gold medal of merit.</p>
<p>Several long journeys abroad mark the succeeding years: to
Denmark and America from 1848 to 1857; to Switzerland, Belgium,
France, Italy, Palestine, and Greece, from 1856 to 1861; to Germany
in 1862, returning the same year. The summer months of 1864 she
spent at &Aring;rsta, which since 1853 had passed out of the hands
of the family. She removed there the year after, and died there on
the 31st of December.</p>
<p>Fredrika Bremer's most successful literary work was in the line
of her earliest writings, descriptive of the every-day life of the
middle classes. Her novels in this line have an unusual charm of
expression, whose definable elements are an unaffected simplicity
and a certain quiet humor which admirably fits the chosen
<i>milieu</i>. Besides the ones already mentioned, 'Presidentens
D&ouml;ttrar' (The President's Daughters), 'Grannarna' (The
Neighbors), 'Hemmet' (The Home), 'Nina,' and others, cultivated
this field. Later she drifted into "tendency" fiction, making her
novels the vehicles for her opinions on important public questions,
such as religion, philanthropy, and above all the equal rights of
women. These later productions, of which 'Hertha' and 'Syskonlif'
are the most important, are far inferior to her earlier work. She
had, however, the satisfaction of seeing the realization of several
of the movements which she had so ardently espoused: the law that
unmarried women in Sweden should attain their majority at
twenty-five years of age; the organization at Stockholm of a
seminary for the education of woman teachers; and certain
parliamentary reforms.</p>
<p>In addition to her novels and short stories, she wrote some
verse, mostly unimportant, and several books of travel, among them
'Hemmen i ny Verlden' (Homes in the New World), containing her
experiences of America; 'Life in the Old World'; and 'Greece and
the Greeks.'</p>

<h3>A HOME-COMING</h3>
<center>From 'The Neighbors'</center>
<br>
<p>LETTER I.--FRANCISCA W. TO MARIA M.</p>
<p>ROSENVIK, 1st June, 18.</p>
<p>Here I am now, dear Maria, in my own house and home, at my own
writing-table, and with my own Bear. And who then is Bear? no doubt
you ask. Who else should he be but my own husband? I call him
<i>Bear</i> because--it so happens. I am seated at the window. The
sun is setting. Two swans are swimming in the lake, and furrow its
clear mirror. Three cows--<i>my cows</i>--are standing on the
verdant margin, quiet, fat, and pensive, and certainly think of
nothing. What excellent cows they are! Now the maid is coming up
with the milk-pail. Delicious milk in the country! But what is not
good in the country? Air and people, food and feelings, earth and
sky, everything there is fresh and cheering.</p>
<p>Now I must introduce you to my place of abode--no! I must begin
farther off. Upon yonder hill, from which I first beheld the valley
in which Rosenvik lies (the hill is some miles in the interior of
Smaaland) do you descry a carriage covered with dust? In it are
seated Bear and his wedded wife. The wife is looking out with
curiosity, for before her lies a valley so beautiful in the
tranquillity of evening! Below are green groves which fringe
mirror-clear lakes, fields of standing corn bend in silken
undulations round gray mountains, and white buildings glance amid
the trees. Round about, pillars of smoke are shooting up vertically
from the wood-covered hills to the serene evening sky. This seems
to indicate the presence of volcanoes, but in point of fact it is
merely the peaceful labor of the husbandmen burning the vegetation,
in order to fertilize the soil. At all events, it is an excellent
thing, and I am delighted, bend forward, and am just thinking about
a happy family in nature,--Paradise, and Adam and Eve,--when
suddenly Bear puts his great paws around me, and presses me so that
I am near giving up the ghost, while, kissing me, he entreats me to
"be comfortable here." I was a little provoked; but when I
perceived the heartfelt intention of the embrace, I could not but
be satisfied.</p>
<p>In this valley, then, was my permanent home: here my new family
was living; here lay Rosenvik; here I was to live with my Bear. We
descended the hill, and the carriage rolled rapidly along the level
way. Bear told me the names of every estate, both in the
neighborhood and at a distance. I listened as if I were dreaming,
but was roused from my reverie when he said with a certain stress,
"<i>Here</i> is the residence of <i>ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i>," and the carriage drove into a courtyard, and
stopped before a large and fine stone house.</p>
<p>"What, are we going to alight here?" "Yes, my love." This was by
no means an agreeable surprise to me. I would gladly have first
driven to my own home, there to prepare myself a little for meeting
my husband's stepmother, of whom I was a little afraid, from the
accounts I had heard of that lady, and the respect Bear entertained
for her. This visit appeared entirely <i>mal &agrave;propos</i> to
me, but Bear has his own ideas, and I perceived from his manner
that it was not expedient then to offer any resistance.</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and on the carriage drawing up, the tones of a
violin became audible to me. "Aha!" said Bear, "so much the
better;" made a ponderous leap from the carriage, and lifted me
out. Of hat-cases and packages, no manner of account was to be
taken. Bear took my hand, ushered me up the steps into the
magnificent hall, and dragged me toward the door from whence the
sounds of music and dancing were heard. "See," thought I, "now I am
to dance in this costume forsooth!" I wished to go into some place
where I could shake the dust from my nose and my bonnet; where I
could at least view myself in a mirror. Impossible! Bear, leading
me by the arm, assured me that I looked "most charming," and
entreated me to mirror myself in his eyes. I then needs must be so
discourteous as to reply that they were "too small." He protested
that they were only the clearer, and opened the door to the
ball-room. "Well, since you lead me to the ball, you shall also
dance with me, you Bear!" I exclaimed in the gayety of despair, so
to speak. "With delight!" cried Bear, and at the same moment we
found ourselves in the salon.</p>
<p>My alarm diminished considerably when I perceived in the
spacious room only a crowd of cleanly attired maids and
serving-men, who were sweeping merrily about with one another. They
were so busied with dancing as scarcely to observe us. Bear then
conducted me to the upper end of the apartment; and there, on a
high seat, I saw a tall and strong lady of about fifty, who was
playing on a violin with zealous earnestness, and beating time with
her foot, which she stamped with energy. On her head she wore a
remarkable and high-projecting cap of black velvet, which I will
call a helmet, because that word occurred to my mind at the very
first view I had of her, and I know no one more appropriate. She
looked well, but singular. It was the lady of General Mansfelt, my
husband's stepmother, <i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re!</i></p>
<p>She speedily cast her large dark-brown eyes on me, instantly
ceased playing, laid aside the violin, and drew herself up with a
proud bearing, but an air of gladness and frankness. Bear led me
towards her. I trembled a little, bowed profoundly, and kissed
<i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re's</i> hand. She kissed my forehead,
and for a while regarded me with such a keen glance, that I was
compelled to abase my eyes, on which she again kissed me most
cordially on lips and forehead, and embraced me almost as lustily
as Bear had. Now it was Bear's turn; he kissed the hand of <i>ma
ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i> right respectfully; she however
offered him her cheek, and they appeared very friendly. "Be
welcome, my dear friends!" said <i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i>,
with a loud, masculine voice. "It was handsome in you to come to me
before driving to your own home. I thank you for it. I would indeed
have given you a better reception had I been prepared; at all
events, I know that 'Welcome is the best cheer.' I hope, my
friends, you stay the evening here?" Bear excused us, said that we
desired to get home soon, that I was fatigued from the journey, but
that we would not drive by Carlsfors without paying our respects to
<i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i>.</p>
<p>"Well, very good, well, very good!" said <i>ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i>, with satisfaction; "we will shortly talk further
about that in the chamber there; but first I must say a few words
to the people here. Hark ye, good friends!" and <i>ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i> knocked with the bow on the back of the violin,
till a general silence ensued in the salon. "My children," she
pursued in a solemn manner, "I have to tell you--a plague upon you!
will you not be still there, at the lower end?--I have to inform
you that my dear son, Lars Anders Werner, has now led home, as his
wedded wife, this Francisca Bur&eacute;n whom you see at his side.
Marriages are made in heaven, my children, and we will supplicate
heaven to complete its work in blessing this conjugal pair. We will
this evening together drink a bumper to their prosperity. That will
do! Now you can continue your dancing, my children. Olof, come you
here, and do your best in playing."</p>
<p>While a murmur of exultation and congratulations went through
the assembly, <i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i> took me by the
hand, and led me, together with Bear, into another room. Here she
ordered punch and glasses to be brought in. In the interim she
thrust her two elbows on the table, placed her clenched hands under
her chin, and gazed steadfastly at me, but with a look which was
rather gloomy than friendly. Bear, perceiving that <i>ma
ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re's</i> review embarrassed me, broached the
subject of the harvest or rural affairs. <i>Ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i> vented a few sighs, so deep that they rather
resembled groans, appeared to make a violent effort to command
herself, answered Bear's questions, and on the arrival of the
punch, drank to us, saying, with a serious look and voice, "Son and
son's wife, your health!" On this she grew more friendly, and said
in a tone of pleasantry, which beseemed her very well, "Lars
Anders, I don't think people can say you have bought the calf in
the sack. Your wife does not by any means look in bad case, and has
a pair of eyes to buy fish with. Little she is, it is true; but
'Little and bold is often more than a match for the great.'"</p>
<p>I laughed, so did <i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i> also; I
began to understand her character and manner. We gossiped a little
while together in a lively manner, and I recounted some little
adventures of travel, which amused her exceedingly. After the lapse
of an hour, we arose to take leave, and <i>ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i> said, with a really charming smile, "I will not
detain you this evening, delighted as I am to see you. I can well
imagine that home is attractive. Stay at home to-morrow, if you
will; but the day after to-morrow come and dine with me. As to the
rest, you know well that you are at all times welcome. Fill now
your glasses, and come and drink the folks' health. Sorrow we
should keep to ourselves, but share joy in common."</p>
<p>We went into the dancing-room with full glasses, <i>ma
ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i> leading the way as herald. They were
awaiting us with bumpers, and <i>ma ch&egrave;re m&egrave;re</i>
addressed the people something in this strain:--"We must not indeed
laugh until we get over the brook; but when we set out on the
voyage of matrimony with piety and good sense, then may be applied
the adage that 'Well begun is half won'; and on that, my friends,
we will drink a skoal to this wedded pair you see before you, and
wish that both they and their posterity may ever 'sit in the
vineyard of our Lord.' Skoal!"</p>
<p>"Skoal! skoal!" resounded from every side. Bear and I emptied
our glasses, and went about and shook a multitude of people by the
hand, till my head was all confusion. When this was over, and we
were preparing to prosecute our journey, <i>ma ch&egrave;re
m&egrave;re</i> came after us on the steps with a packet or bundle
in her hand, and said in a friendly manner, "Take this cold roast
veal with you, children, for breakfast to-morrow morning. After
that, you must fatten and consume your own calves. But forget not,
daughter-in-law, that I get back my napkin. No, you shan't carry
it, dear child, you have enough to do with your bag and mantle.
Lars Anders shall carry the roast veal." And as if Lars Anders had
been still a little boy, she charged him with the bundle, showed
him how he was to carry it, and Bear did as she said. Her last
words were, "Forget not that I get my napkin again!" I looked with
some degree of wonder at Bear; but he smiled, and lifted me into
the carriage.</p>

<h3>THE LANDED PROPRIETOR</h3>
<center>From 'The Home'</center>
<br>
<p>Louise possessed the quality of being a good listener in a
higher degree than any one else in the family, and therefore she
heard more than any one else of his Excellency; but not of him
only, for Jacobi had always something to tell her, always something
to consult her about; and in case she were not too much occupied
with her thoughts about the weaving, he could always depend upon
the most intense sympathy, and the best advice both with regard to
moral questions and economical arrangements, dress, plans for the
future, and so forth. He also gave her good advice--which however
was very seldom followed--when she was playing Postilion; he also
drew patterns for her tapestry work, and was very fond of reading
aloud to her--but novels rather than sermons.</p>
<p>But he was not long allowed to sit by her side alone; for very
soon a person seated himself at her other side whom we will call
the <i>Landed Proprietor</i>, as he was chiefly remarkable for the
possession of a large estate in the vicinity of the town.</p>
<p>The Landed Proprietor seemed to be disposed to dispute with the
Candidate--let us continue to call him so, as we are all, in one
way or the other, Candidates in this world--the place which he
possessed. The Landed Proprietor had, besides his estate, a very
portly body; round, healthy-looking cheeks; a pair of large gray
eyes, remarkable for their want of expression; and a little rosy
mouth, which preferred mastication to speaking, which laughed
without meaning, and which now began to direct to "Cousin
Louise"--for he considered himself related to the Lagman--several
short speeches, which we will recapitulate in the following
chapter, headed</p>
<p>STRANGE QUESTIONS</p>
<p>"Cousin Louise, are you fond of fish--bream for instance?" asked
the Landed Proprietor one evening, as he seated himself by the side
of Louise, who was busy working a landscape in tapestry.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes! bream is a very good fish," answered she,
phlegmatically, without looking up.</p>
<p>"Oh, with red-wine sauce, delicious! I have splendid fishing on
my estate, Oestanvik. Big fellows of bream! I fish for them
myself."</p>
<p>"Who is the large fish there?" inquired Jacobi of Henrik, with
an impatient sneer; "and what is it to him if your sister Louise is
fond of bream or not?"</p>
<p>"Because then she might like him too, <i>mon cher</i>! A very
fine and solid fellow is my cousin Thure of Oestanvik. I advise you
to cultivate his acquaintance. What now, Gabrielle dear, what now,
your Highness?"</p>
<p>"What is that which--"</p>
<p>"Yes, what is it? I shall lose my head over that riddle. Mamma
dear, come and help your stupid son!"</p>
<p>"No, no! Mamma knows it already. She must not say it!" exclaimed
Gabrielle with fear.</p>
<p>"What king do you place above all other kings, Magister?" asked
Petrea for the second time,--having this evening her "raptus" of
questioning.</p>
<p>"Charles the Thirteenth," answered the Candidate, and listened
for what Louise was going to reply to the Landed Proprietor.</p>
<p>"Do you like birds, Cousin Louise?" asked the Landed
Proprietor.</p>
<p>"Oh yes, particularly the throstle," answered Louise.</p>
<p>"Well,--I am glad of that!" said the Landed Proprietor. "On my
estate, Oestanvik, there is an immense quantity of throstles. I
often go out with my gun, and shoot them for my dinner. Piff, paff!
with two shots I have directly a whole dishful."</p>
<p>Petrea, who was asked by no one "Do you like birds, cousin?" and
who wished to occupy the Candidate, did not let herself be deterred
by his evident confusion, but for the second time put the following
question:--"Do you think, Magister, that people before the Flood
were really worse than they are nowadays?"</p>
<p>"Oh, much, much better," answered the Candidate.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of roasted hare, Cousin Louise?" asked the Landed
Proprietor.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of roasted hare, Magister?" whispered Petrea
waggishly to Jacobi.</p>
<p>"Brava, Petrea!" whispered her brother to her.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of cold meat, Cousin Louise?" asked the Landed
Proprietor, as he was handing Louise to the supper-table.</p>
<p>"Are you fond of Landed Proprietor?" whispered Henrik to her as
she left it.</p>
<p>Louise answered just as a cathedral would have answered: she
looked very solemn and was silent.</p>
<p>After supper Petrea was quite excited, and left nobody alone who
by any possibility could answer her. "Is reason sufficient for
mankind? What is the ground of morals? What is properly the meaning
of 'revelation'? Why is everything so badly arranged in the State?
Why must there be rich and poor?" etc., etc.</p>
<p>"Dear Petrea!" said Louise, "what use can there be in asking
those questions?"</p>
<p>It was an evening for questions; they did not end even when the
company had broken up.</p>
<p>"Don't you think, Elise," said the Lagman to his wife when they
were alone, "that our little Petrea begins to be disagreeable with
her continual questioning and disputing? She leaves no one in
peace, and is stirred up herself the whole time. She will make
herself ridiculous if she keeps on in this way."</p>
<p>"Yes, if she does keep on so. But I have a feeling that she will
change. I have observed her very particularly for some time, and do
you know, I think there is really something very uncommon in that
girl."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, there is certainly something uncommon in her. Her
liveliness and the many games and schemes which she invents--"</p>
<p>"Yes, don't you think they indicate a decided talent for the
fine arts? And then her extraordinary thirst for learning: every
morning, between three and four o'clock, she gets up in order to
read or write, or to work at her compositions. That is not at all a
common thing. And may not her uneasiness, her eagerness to question
and dispute, arise from a sort of intellectual hunger? Ah, from
such hunger, which many women must suffer throughout their lives,
from want of literary food,--from such an emptiness of the soul
arise disquiet, discontent, nay, innumerable faults."</p>
<p>"I believe you are right, Elise," said the Lagman, "and no
condition in life is sadder, particularly in more advanced years.
But this shall not be the lot of our Petrea--that I will promise.
What do you think now would benefit her most?"</p>
<p>"My opinion is that a serious and continued plan of study would
assist in regulating her mind. She is too much left to herself with
her confused tendencies, with her zeal and her inquiry. I am too
ignorant myself to lead and instruct her, you have too little time,
and she has no one here who can properly direct her young and
unregulated mind. Sometimes I almost pity her, for her sisters
don't understand at all what is going on within her, and I confess
it is often painful to myself; I wish I were more able to assist
her. Petrea needs some ground on which to take her stand. Her
thoughts require more firmness; from the want of this comes her
uneasiness. She is like a flower without roots, which is moved
about by wind and waves."</p>
<p>"She shall take root, she shall find ground as sure as it is to
be found in the world," said the Lagman, with a serious and beaming
eye, at the same time striking his hand on the book containing the
law of West Gotha, so that it fell to the ground. "We will consider
more of this, Elise," continued he: "Petrea is still too young for
us to judge with certainty of her talents and tendencies. But if
they turn out to be what they appear, then she shall never feel any
hunger as long as I live and can procure bread for my family. You
know my friend, the excellent Bishop B----: perhaps we can at first
confide our Petrea to his guidance. After a few years we shall see;
she is still only a child. Don't you think that we ought to speak
to Jacobi, in order to get him to read and converse with her?
Apropos, how is it with Jacobi? I imagine that he begins to be too
attentive to Louise."</p>
<p>"Well, well! you are not so far wrong; and even our cousin Thure
of Oestanvik,--have you perceived anything there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I did perceive something yesterday evening; what the deuce
was his meaning with those stupid questions he put to her? 'Does
cousin like this?' or 'Is cousin fond of that?' I don't like that
at all myself. Louise is not yet full-grown, and already people
come and ask her, 'Does cousin like--?' Well, it may signify very
little after all, which would perhaps please me best. What a pity,
however, that our cousin is not a little more manly; for he has
certainly got a most beautiful estate, and so near us."</p>
<p>"Yes, a pity; because, as he is at present, I am almost sure
Louise would find it impossible to give him her hand."</p>
<p>"You do not believe that her inclination is toward Jacobi?"</p>
<p>"To tell the truth, I fancy that this is the case."</p>
<p>"Nay, that would be very unpleasant and very unwise: I am very
fond of Jacobi, but he has nothing and is nothing."</p>
<p>"But, my dear, he may get something and become something; I
confess, dear Ernst, that I believe he would suit Louise better for
a husband than any one else we know, and I would with pleasure call
him my son."</p>
<p>"Would you, Elise? then I must also prepare myself to do the
same. You have had most trouble and most labor with the children,
it is therefore right that you should decide in their affairs."</p>
<p>"Ernst, you are so kind!"</p>
<p>"Say just, Elise; not more than just. Besides, it is my opinion
that our thoughts and inclinations will not differ much. I confess
that Louise appears to me to be a great treasure, and I know of
nobody I could give her to with all my heart; but if Jacobi obtains
her affections, I feel that I could not oppose their union,
although it would be painful to me on account of his uncertain
prospects. He is really dear to me, and we are under great
obligations to him on account of Henrik; his excellent heart, his
honesty, and his good qualities, will make him as good a citizen as
a husband and father, and I consider him to be one of the most
agreeable men to associate with daily. But, God bless me! I speak
as if I wished the union, but that is far from my desire: I would
much rather keep my daughters at home, so long as they find
themselves happy with me; but when girls grow up, there is never
any peace to depend on. I wish all lovers and questioners a long
way off. Here we could live altogether as in a kingdom of heaven,
now that we have got everything in such order. Some small
improvements may still be wanted, but this will be all right if we
are only left in peace. I have been thinking that we could so
easily make a wardrobe here: do you see on this side of the
wall--don't you think if we were to open--What! are you asleep
already, my dear?"</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Louise was often teased about Cousin Thure; Cousin Thure was
often teased about Cousin Louise. He liked very much to be teased
about his Cousin Louise, and it gave him great pleasure to be told
that Oestanvik wanted a mistress, that he himself wanted a good
wife, and that Louise Frank was decidedly one of the wisest and
most amiable girls in the whole neighborhood, and of the most
respectable family. The Landed Proprietor was half ready to receive
congratulations on his betrothal. What the supposed bride thought
about the matter, however, is difficult to divine. Louise was
certainly always polite to her "Cousin Thure," but more
indifference than attachment seemed to be expressed in this
politeness; and she declined, with a decision astonishing to many a
person, his constantly repeated invitations to make a tour to
Oestanvik in his new landau drawn by "my chestnut horses,"
four-in-hand. It was said by many that the agreeable and friendly
Jacobi was much nearer to Louise's heart than the rich Landed
Proprietor. But even towards Jacobi her behavior was so uniform, so
quiet, and so unconstrained that nobody knew what to think. Very
few knew so well as we do that Louise considered it in accordance
with the dignity of a woman to show perfect indifference to the
attentions or <i>doux propos</i> of men, until they had openly and
fully explained themselves. She despised coquetry to that degree
that she feared everything which had the least appearance of it.
Her young friends used to joke with her upon her strong notions in
this respect, and often told her that she would remain
unmarried.</p>
<p>"That may be!" answered Louise calmly.</p>
<p>One day she was told that a gentleman had said, "I will not
stand up for any girl who is not a little coquettish!"</p>
<p>"Then he may remain sitting!" answered Louise, with a great deal
of dignity.</p>
<p>Louise's views with regard to the dignity of woman, her serious
and decided principles, and her manner of expressing them, amused
her young friends, at the same time that they inspired them with
great regard for her, and caused many little contentions and
discussions in which Louise fearlessly, though not without some
excess, defended what was right. These contentions, which began in
merriment, sometimes ended quite differently.</p>
<p>A young and somewhat coquettish married lady felt herself one
day wounded by the severity with which Louise judged the coquetry
of her sex, particularly of married ladies, and in revenge she made
use of some words which awakened Louise's astonishment and anger at
the same time. An explanation followed between the two, the
consequence of which was a complete rupture between Louise and the
young lady, together with an altered disposition of mind in the
former, which she in vain attempted to conceal. She had been
unusually joyous and lively during the first days of her stay at
Axelholm; but she now became silent and thoughtful, often absent;
and some people thought that she seemed less friendly than formerly
towards the Candidate, but somewhat more attentive to the Landed
Proprietor, although she constantly declined his invitation "to
take a tour to Oestanvik."</p>
<p>The evening after this explanation took place, Elise was engaged
with Jacobi in a lively conversation in the balcony.</p>
<p>"And if," said Jacobi, "if I endeavor to win her affections, oh,
tell me! would her parents, would her mother see it without
displeasure? Ah, speak openly with me; the happiness of my life
depends upon it!"</p>
<p>"You have my approval and my good wishes," answered Elise; "I
tell you now what I have often told my husband, that I should very
much like to call you my son!"</p>
<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Jacobi, deeply affected, falling on his knees
and pressing Elise's hand to his lips: "oh, that every act in my
life might prove my gratitude, my love--!"</p>
<p>At this moment Louise, who had been looking for her mother,
approached the balcony; she saw Jacobi's action and heard his
words. She withdrew quickly, as if she had been stung by a
serpent.</p>
<p>From this time a great change was more and more perceptible in
her. Silent, shy, and very pale, she moved about like a dreaming
person in the merry circle at Axelholm, and willingly agreed to her
mother's proposal to shorten her stay at this place.</p>
<p>Jacobi, who was as much astonished as sorry at Louise's sudden
unfriendliness towards him, began to think the place was somehow
bewitched, and wished more than once to leave it.</p>

<h3>A FAMILY PICTURE</h3>
<center>From 'The Home'</center>
<br>
<p>The family is assembled in the library; tea is just finished.
Louise, at the pressing request of Gabrielle and Petrea, lays out
the cards in order to tell the sisters their fortune. The Candidate
seats himself beside her, and seems to have made up his mind to be
a little more cheerful. But then "the object" looks more like a
cathedral than ever. The Landed Proprietor enters, bows, blows his
nose, and kisses the hand of his "gracious aunt."</p>
<p><i>Landed Proprietor</i>--Very cold this evening; I think we
shall have frost.</p>
<p><i>Elise</i>--It is a miserable spring; we have just read a
melancholy account of the famine in the northern provinces; these
years of dearth are truly unfortunate.</p>
<p><i>Landed Proprietor</i>--Oh yes, the famine up there. No, let
us talk of something else; that is too gloomy. I have had my peas
covered with straw. Cousin Louise, are you fond of playing
Patience? I am very fond of it myself; it is so composing. At
Oestanvik I have got very small cards for Patience; I am quite sure
you would like them, Cousin Louise.</p>
<p>The Landed Proprietor seats himself on the other side of Louise.
The Candidate is seized with a fit of curious shrugs.</p>
<p><i>Louise</i>--This is not Patience, but a little conjuring by
means of which I can tell future things. Shall I tell your fortune,
Cousin Thure?</p>
<p><i>Landed Proprietor</i>--Oh yes! do tell my fortune; but don't
tell me anything disagreeable. If I hear anything disagreeable in
the evening, I always dream of it at night. Tell me now from the
cards that I shall have a pretty little wife;--a wife beautiful and
amiable as Cousin Louise.</p>
<p><i>The Candidate (with an expression in his eyes as if he would
send the Landed Proprietor head-over-heels to Oestanvik)</i>--I
don't know whether Miss Louise likes flattery.</p>
<p><i>Landed Proprietor (who takes no notice of his
rival)</i>--Cousin Louise, are you fond of blue?</p>
<p><i>Louise</i>--Blue? It is a pretty color; but I almost like
green better.</p>
<p><i>Landed Proprietor</i>--Well, that's very droll; it suits
exceedingly well. At Oestanvik my drawing-room furniture is blue;
beautiful light-blue satin. But in my bedroom I have green moreen.
Cousin Louise, I believe really--</p>
<p>The Candidate coughs as though he were going to be suffocated,
and rushes out of the room. Louise looks after him and sighs, and
afterwards sees in the cards so many misfortunes for Cousin Thure
that he is quite frightened. "The peas frosted!"--"conflagration in
the drawing-room"--and at last "a basket" ["the mitten"]. The
Landed Proprietor declares still laughingly that he will not
receive "a basket." The sisters smile and make their remarks.</p>

<h2>CLEMENS BRENTANO</h2>
<h3>(1778-1842)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he intellectual upheaval in Germany at the beginning of this
century brought a host of remarkable characters upon the literary
stage, and none more gifted, more whimsical, more winning than
Clemens Brentano, the erratic son of a brilliant family. Born
September 8th, 1778, at Ehrenbreitstein, Brentano spent his youth
among the stimulating influences which accompanied the renaissance
of German culture. His grandmother, Sophie de la Roche, had been
the close friend of Wieland, and his mother the youthful companion
of Goethe. Clemens, after a vain attempt to follow in the
mercantile footsteps of his father, went to Jena, where he met the
Schlegels; and here his brilliant but unsteady literary career
began.</p>
<p>In 1803 he married the talented Sophie Mareau, but three years
later his happiness was terminated by her death. His next
matrimonial venture was, however, a failure: an elopement in 1808
with the daughter of a Frankfort banker was quickly followed by a
divorce, and he thereafter led the uncontrolled life of an errant
poet. Among his early writings, published under the pseudonym of
'Marie,' were several satires and dramas and a novel entitled
'Godwi,' which he himself called "a romance gone mad." The meeting
with Achim von Arnim, who subsequently married his sister Bettina,
decided his fate: he embarked in literature once and for all in
close association with Von Arnim. Together they compiled a
collection of several hundred folk-songs of the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, under the name of 'Des
Knaben Wunderhorn' (The Boy's Wonderhorn), 1806-1808. That so
musical a people as the Germans should be masters of lyric poetry
is but natural,--every longing, every impression, every impulse
gushes into song; and in 'Des Knaben Wunderhorn' we hear the
tuneful voices of a na&iuml;ve race, singing what they have seen or
dreamed or felt during three hundred years. The work is dedicated
to Goethe, who wrote an almost enthusiastic review of it for the
Literary Gazette of Jena. "Every lover or master of musical art,"
he says, "should have this volume upon his piano."</p>
<p>The 'Wunderhorn' was greeted by the German public with
extraordinary cordiality. It was in fact an epoch-making work, the
pioneer in the new field of German folk poetry. It carried out in a
purely national spirit the efforts which Herder had made in behalf
of the folk-songs of all peoples. It revealed the spirit of the
time. 1806 was the year of the battle of Jena, and Germany in her
hour of deepest humiliation gave ear to the encouraging voices from
out her own past. "The editors of the 'Wunderhorn,'" said their
friend G&ouml;rres, "have deserved of their countrymen a civic
crown, for having saved from destruction what yet remained to be
saved;" and on this civic crown the poets' laurels are still
green.</p>
<p>Brentano's contagious laughter may even now be heard re-echoing
through the pages of his book on 'The Philistine' (1811). His
dramatic power is evinced in the broadly conceived play 'Die
Gr&uuml;ndung Prags' (The Founding of Prague: 1815); but it is upon
two stories, told in the simple style of the folk-tale, that his
widest popularity is founded. 'Die Geschichte vom braven Casperl
und der sch&ouml;nen Annerl' (The Story of Good Casper and Pretty
Annie) and his fable of 'Gockel, Hinkel, und Gackeleia,' both of
the year 1838, are still an indispensable part of the reading of
every German boy and girl.</p>
<p>Like his brilliant sister, Brentano is a fascinating figure in
literature. He was amiable and winning, full of quips and cranks,
and with an inexhaustible fund of stories. Astonishing tales of
adventure, related with great circumstantiality of detail, and of
which he himself was the hero, played an important part in his
conversation. Tieck once said he had never known a better
improvisatore than Brentano, nor one who could "lie more
gracefully."</p>
<p>When Brentano was forty years of age a total change came over
his life. The witty and fascinating man of the world was
transformed into a pious and gloomy ascetic. The visions of the
stigmatized nun of D&uuml;lmen, Katharina Emmerich, attracted him,
and he remained under her influence until her death in 1824. These
visions he subsequently published as the 'Life of the Virgin Mary.'
The eccentricities of his later years bordered upon insanity. He
died in the Catholic faith in the year 1842.</p>

<h2>ELISABETH BRENTANO (BETTINA VON ARNIM)</h2>
<h3>(1785-1859)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-n.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>o picture of German life at the beginning of this century would
be complete which did not include the distinguished women who left
their mark upon the time. Among these Bettina von Arnim stands
easily foremost. There was something triumphant in her nature,
which in her youth manifested itself in her splendid enthusiasm for
the two great geniuses who dominated her life,--Goethe and
Beethoven,--and which, in the lean years when Germany was
overclouded, maintained itself by an inexhaustible optimism. Her
merry willfulness and wit covered a warm heart and a vigorous mind;
and both of her great idols understood her and took her
seriously.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/brentano.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Elisabeth Brentano</b></p>
<p>Elisabeth Brentano was the daughter of Goethe's friend,
Maximiliane de la Roche. She was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main in
1785, and was brought up after the death of her mother under the
somewhat peculiar influence of the highly-strung Caroline von
G&uuml;nderode. Through her filial intimacy with Goethe's mother,
she came to know the poet; and out of their friendship grew the
correspondence which formed the basis of Bettina's famous book,
'Goethe's Briefwechsel mit einem Kinde' (Goethe's Correspondence
with a Child). She attached herself with unbounded enthusiasm to
Goethe, and he responded with affectionate tact. To him Bettina was
the embodiment of the loving grace and willfulness of 'Mignon.'</p>
<p>In 1811 these relations were interrupted, owing to Bettina's
attitude toward Goethe's wife. In the same year she married Achim
von Arnim, one of the most refined poets and noblest characters of
that brilliant circle. The marriage was an ideal one; each
cherished and delighted in the genius of the other, but in 1831 the
death of Von Arnim brought this happiness to an end. Goethe died in
the following year, and Germany went into mourning. Then in 1835
Bettina appeared before the world for the first time as an
authoress, in 'Goethe's Correspondence with a Child.' The
dithyrambic exaltation, the unrestrained but beautiful enthusiasm
of the book came like an electric shock. Into an atmosphere of
spiritual stagnation, these letters brought a fresh access of
vitality and hope. Bettina's old friendly relations with Goethe had
been resumed later in life, and in a letter written to her niece
she gives a charming account of the visit to the poet in 1824,
which proved to be her last. This letter first saw the light in
1896, and an extract from it has been included below.</p>
<p>The inspiration which went out from Bettina's magnetic nature
was profound. She had her part in every great movement of her time,
from the liberation of Greece to the fight with cholera in Berlin.
During the latter, her devotion to the cause of the suffering poor
in Berlin opened her eyes to the miseries of the common people; and
she wrote a work full of indignant fervor, 'Dies Buch geh&ouml;rt
dem K&ouml;nig' (This Book belongs to the King), in consequence of
which her welcome at the court of Frederick William IV. grew cool.
A subsequent book, written in a similar vein, was suppressed. But
Bettina's love of the people, as of every cause in which she was
interested, was genuine and not to be quenched; she acted upon the
maxim once expressed by Emerson, "Every brave heart must treat
society as a child, and never allow it to dictate." Emerson greatly
admired Bettina, and Louisa M. Alcott relates that she first made
acquaintance with the famous 'Correspondence' when in her girlhood
she was left to browse in Emerson's library. Bettina's influence
was most keenly felt by the young, and she had the youth of Germany
at her feet. She died in 1859.</p>
<p>There is in Weimar a picture in which are represented the
literary men of the period, grouped as in Raphael's School of
Athens, with Goethe and Schiller occupying the centre. Upon the
broad steps which lead to the elevation where they are standing, is
the girlish figure of Bettina bending forward and holding a laurel
wreath in her hand. This is the position which she occupies in the
history of German literature.</p>

<h3>DEDICATION: TO GOETHE</h3>
<center>From 'Goethe's Correspondence with a Child'</center>
<br>
<p>Thou, who knowest love, and the refinement of sentiment, oh how
beautiful is everything in thee! How the streams of life rush
through thy sensitive heart, and plunge with force into the cold
waves of thy time, then boil and bubble up till mountain and vale
flush with the glow of life, and the forests stand with glistening
boughs upon the shore of thy being, and all upon which rests thy
glance is filled with happiness and life! O God, how happy were I
with thee! And were I winging my flight far over all times, and far
over thee, I would fold my pinions and yield myself wholly to the
domination of thine eyes.</p>
<p>Men will never understand thee, and those nearest to thee will
most thoroughly disown and betray thee; I look into the future, and
I hear them cry, "Stone him!" Now, when thine own inspiration, like
a lion, stands beside thee and guards thee, vulgarity ventures not
to approach thee. Thy mother said recently, "The men to-day are all
like Gerning, who always says, 'We, the superfluous learned';" and
she speaks truly, for he is superfluous. Rather be dead than
superfluous! But I am not so, for I am thine, because I recognize
thee in all things. I know that when the clouds lift themselves up
before the sun-god, they will soon be depressed by his fiery hand;
I know that he endures no shadow except that which his own fame
seeks; the rest of consciousness will overshadow thee. I know, when
he descends in the evening, that he will again appear in the
morning with golden front. Thou art eternal, therefore it is good
for me to be with thee.</p>
<p>When, in the evening, I am alone in my dark room, and the
neighbors' lights are thrown upon my wall, they sometimes light up
thy bust; or when all is silent in the city, here and there a dog
barks or a cock crows: I know not why, but it seems something
beyond human to me; I know what I shall do to still my pain.</p>
<p>I would fain speak with thee otherwise than with words; I would
fain press myself to thy heart. I feel that my soul is aflame. How
fearfully still is the air before the storm! So stand now my
thoughts, cold and silent, and my heart surges like the sea. Dear,
dear Goethe! A reminiscence of thee breaks the spell; the signs of
fire and warfare sink slowly down in my sky, and thou art like the
in-streaming moonlight. Thou art great and glorious, and better
than all that I have ever known and experienced up to this time.
Thy whole life is so good!</p>

<h3>TO GOETHE</h3>
<br>
<p>CASSEL, August 13th, 1807.</p>
<br>
<p>Who can interpret and measure what is passing within me? I am
happy now in remembrance of the past, which I scarcely was when
that past was the present. To my sensitive heart the surprise of
being with thee, the coming and going and returning in a few
blessed days--this was all like clouds flitting across my heaven;
through my too near presence I feared it might be darkened by my
shadow, as it is ever darker when it nears the earth; now, in the
distance, it is mild and lofty and ever clear.</p>
<p>I would fain press thy dear hand with both of mine to my bosom,
and say to thee, "How peace and content have come to me since I
have known thee!"</p>
<p>I know that the evening has not come when life's twilight
gathers in my heart: oh, would it were so! Would that I had lived
out my days, that my wishes and joys were fulfilled, and that they
could all be heaped upon thee, that thou mightst be therewith
decked and crowned as with evergreen bays.</p>
<p>When I was alone with thee on that evening I could not
comprehend thee: thou didst smile at me because I was moved, and
laughed at me because I wept; but why? And yet it was thy laughter,
the <i>tone</i> of thy laughter, which moved me to tears; and I am
content, and see, under the cloak of this riddle, roses burst forth
which spring alike from sadness and joy. Yes, thou art right,
prophet: I shall yet with light heart struggle up through jest and
mirth; I shall weary myself with struggling as I did in my
childhood (ah, it seems as if it were but yesterday!) when with the
exuberance of joy I wandered through the blossoming fields, pulling
up the flowers by the roots and throwing them into the water. But I
wish to seek rest in a warm, firm earnestness, and there at hand
standest thou, smiling prophet!</p>
<p>I say to thee yet once more: Whoever in this wide world
understands what is passing within me, who, am so restful in thee,
so silent, so unwavering in my feeling? I could, like the
mountains, bear nights and days in the past without disturbing thee
in thy reflections! And yet when at times the wind bears the
fragrance and the germs together from the blossoming world up to
the mountain heights, they will be intoxicated with delight as I
was yesterday. Then I loved the world, then I was as glad as a
gushing, murmuring spring in which the sun for the first time
shines.</p>
<p>Farewell, sublime one who blindest and intimidatest me! From
this steep rock upon which my love has in life-danger ventured, I
cannot clamber down. I cannot think of descending, for I should
break my neck in the attempt.</p>

<h3>BETTINA'S LAST MEETING WITH GOETHE</h3>
<br>
<p>From a Letter to her Niece in 1824, first published in 1896</p>
<p>IN THE evening I was alone again with Goethe. Had any one
observed us, he would have had something to tell to posterity.
Goethe's peculiarities were exhibited to the full: first he would
growl at me, then to make it all up again he would caress me, with
the most flattering words. His bottle of wine he kept in the
adjoining room, because I had reproached him for his drinking the
night before: on some pretext or other he disappeared from the
scene half a dozen times in order to drink a glass. I pretended to
notice nothing; but at parting I told him that twelve glasses of
wine wouldn't hurt him, and that he had had only six. "How do you
know that so positively?" he said. "I heard the gurgle of the
bottle in the next room, and I heard you drinking, and then you
have betrayed yourself to me, as Solomon in the Song of Songs
betrayed himself to his beloved, by your breath." "You are an
arrant rogue," he said; "now take yourself off," and he brought the
candle to light me out. But I sprang in front of him and knelt upon
the threshold of the room. "Now I shall see if I can shut you in,
and whether you are a good spirit or an evil one, like the rat in
Faust; I kiss this threshold and bless it, for over it daily passes
the most glorious human spirit and my best friend." "Over you and
your love I shall never pass," he answered, "it is too dear to me;
and around your spirit I creep so" (and he carefully paced around
the spot where I was kneeling), "for you are too artful, and it is
better to keep on good terms with you." And so he dismissed me with
tears in his eyes. I remained standing in the dark before his door,
to gulp down my emotion. I was thinking that this door, which I had
closed with my own hand, had separated me from him in all
probability forever. Whoever comes near him must confess that his
genius has partly passed into goodness; the fiery sun of his spirit
is transformed at its setting into a soft purple light.</p>

<h2>JOHN BRIGHT</h2>
<h3>(1811-1889)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ohn Bright was the modern representative of the ancient Tribunes
of the people or Demagogues (in the original and perfectly
honorable sense); and a full comparison of his work and position
with those of the Cleons or the Gracchi would almost be an outline
of the respective peoples, polities, and problems. He was a higher
type of man and politician than Cleon,--largely because the English
aristocracy is not an unpatriotic and unprincipled clique like the
Athenian, ready to use any weapon from murder down or to make their
country a province of a foreign empire rather than give up their
class monopoly of power; but like his prototype he was a democrat
by nature as well as profession, the welfare of the common people
at once his passion and his political livelihood, full of faith
that popular instincts are both morally right and intellectually
sound, and all his own instincts and most of his labors
antagonistic to those of the aristocracy. It is a phase of the same
fact to say that he also represented the active force of religious
feeling in politics, as opposed to pure secular statesmanship.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/bright.jpg" width="45%" alt=""><br>
<b>John Bright</b></p>
<p>The son of a Quaker manufacturer of Rochdale, England, and born
near that place November 16th, 1811, he began his public career
when a mere boy as a stirring and effective temperance orator, his
ready eloquence and intense earnestness prevailing over an
ungraceful manner and a bad delivery; he wrought all his life for
popular education and for the widest extension of the franchise;
and being a Quaker and a member of the Peace Society, he opposed
all war on principle, fighting the Crimean War bitterly, and
leaving the Gladstone Cabinet in 1882 on account of the bombardment
of Alexandria. He was retired from the service of the public for
some time on account of his opposition to the Crimean War; but Mr.
Gladstone, who differed from him on this point, calls it the action
of his life most worthy of honor. He was perhaps the most warlike
opponent of war ever high in public life; the pugnacious and
aggressive agitator, pouring out floods of fiery oratory to the
effect that nobody ought to fight anybody, was a curious
paradox.</p>
<p>He was by far the most influential English friend of the North
in the Civil War, and the magic of his eloquence and his name was a
force of perhaps decisive potency in keeping the working classes on
the same side; so that mass meetings of unemployed laborers with
half-starving families resolved that they would rather starve
altogether than help to perpetuate slavery in America. He shares
with Richard Cobden the credit of having obtained free trade for
England: Bright's thrilling oratory was second only to Cobden's
organizing power in winning the victory, and both had the immense
weight of manufacturers opposing their own class. That he opposed
the game laws and favored electoral reform is a matter of
course.</p>
<p>Mr. Bright entered on an active political career in 1839, when
he joined the Anti-Corn-Law League. He first became a member of
Parliament in 1843, and illustrates a most valuable feature of
English political practice. When a change of feeling in one place
prevented his re-election, he selected another which was glad to
honor itself by having a great man represent it, so that the
country was not robbed of a statesman by a village faction; and
there being no spoils system, he did not have to waste his time in
office-jobbing to keep his seat. He sat first for Durham, then for
Manchester, and finally for Birmingham, remaining in public life
over forty years; and never had to make a "deal" or get any one an
office in all that period.</p>
<p>He was in Mr. Gladstone's Cabinet from 1868 to 1870, and again
from 1873 to 1882. On the Home Rule question the two old friends
and long co-workers divided; Mr. Bright, with more than half the
oldest and sincerest friends of liberty and haters of oppression in
England, holding the step to be political suicide for the British
Empire.</p>
<p>As an orator, Mr. Bright stood in a sense alone. He was direct
and logical; he carefully collected and massed his facts, and used
strong, homely Saxon English, and short crisp words; he was a
master of telling epigram whose force lay in its truth as much as
in its humor. Several volumes of his speeches have been published:
'On Public Affairs'; 'On Parliamentary Reform'; 'On Questions of
Public Policy'; 'On the American Question,' etc. His life has been
written by Gilchrist, Smith, Robertson, and others. He died March
27th, 1889.</p>

<h3>FROM THE SPEECH ON THE CORN LAWS (1843)</h3>
<br>
<p>It must not be supposed, because I wish to represent the
interest of the many, that I am hostile to the interest of the
few.</p>
<p>But is it not perfectly certain that if the foundation of the
most magnificent building be destroyed and undermined, the whole
fabric itself is in danger? Is it not certain, also, that the vast
body of the people who form the foundation of the social fabric, if
they are suffering, if they are trampled upon, if they are
degraded, if they are discontented, if "their hands are against
every man, and every man's hands are against them," if they do not
flourish as well, reasonably speaking, as the classes who are above
them because they are richer and more powerful,--then are those
classes as much in danger as the working classes themselves?</p>
<p>There never was a revolution in any country which destroyed the
great body of the people. There have been convulsions of a most
dire character which have overturned old-established monarchies and
have hurled thrones and sceptres to the dust. There have been
revolutions which have brought down most powerful aristocracies,
and swept them from the face of the earth forever, but never was
there a revolution yet which destroyed the people. And whatever may
come as a consequence of the state of things in this country, of
this we may rest assured: that the common people, that the great
bulk of our countrymen will remain and survive the shock, though it
may be that the Crown and the aristocracy and the Church may be
leveled with the dust, and rise no more. In seeking to represent
the working classes, and in standing up for their rights and
liberties, I hold that I am also defending the rights and liberties
of the middle and richer classes of society. Doing justice to one
class cannot inflict injustice on any other class, and "justice and
impartiality to all" is what we all have a right to from
government. And we have a right to clamor; and so long as I have
breath, so long will I clamor against the oppression which I see to
exist, and in favor of the rights of the great body of the
people....</p>
<p>What is the condition in which we are? I have already spoken of
Ireland. You know that hundreds of thousands meet there, week after
week, in various parts of the country, to proclaim to all the world
the tyranny under which they suffer. You know that in South Wales,
at this moment, there is an insurrection of the most extraordinary
character going on, and that the Government is sending, day after
day, soldiers and artillery amongst the innocent inhabitants of
that mountainous country for the purpose of putting down the
insurrection thereby raised and carried on. You know that in the
Staffordshire ironworks almost all the workmen are now out and in
want of wages, from want of employment and from attempting to
resist the inevitable reduction of wages which must follow
restriction upon trade. You know that in August last, Lancashire
and Yorkshire rose in peaceful insurrection to proclaim to the
world, and in face of Heaven, the wrongs of an insulted and
oppressed people. I know that my own neighborhood is unsettled and
uncomfortable. I know that in your own city your families are
suffering. Yes, I have been to your cottages and seen their
condition. Thanks to my canvass of Durham, I have been able to see
the condition of many honest and independent--or
ought-to-be-independent--and industrious artisans. I have seen even
freemen of your city sitting, looking disconsolate and sad. Their
hands were ready to labor; their skill was ready to produce all
that their trade demanded. They were as honest and industrious as
any man in this assembly, but no man hired them. They were in a
state of involuntary idleness, and were driving fast to the point
of pauperism. I have seen their wives, too, with three or four
children about them--one in the cradle, one at the breast. I have
seen their countenances, and I have seen the signs of their
sufferings. I have seen the emblems and symbols of affliction such
as I did not expect to see in this city. Ay! and I have seen those
little children who at not a distant day will be the men and women
of this city of Durham; I have seen their poor little wan faces and
anxious looks, as if the furrows of old age were coming upon them
before they had escaped from the age of childhood. I have seen all
this in this city, and I have seen far more in the neighborhood
from which I have come. You have seen, in all probability, people
from my neighborhood walking your streets and begging for that
bread which the Corn Laws would not allow them to earn.</p>
<blockquote>"Bread-taxed weaver, all can see<br>
What the tax hath done for thee,<br>
And thy children, vilely led,<br>
Singing hymns for shameful bread,<br>
Till the stones of every street<br>
Know their little naked feet."</blockquote>
<p>This is what the Corn Law does for the weavers of my
neighborhood, and for the weavers and artisans of yours....</p>

<a name="BRIGHT02"></a>
<h3>FROM THE SPEECH ON INCENDIARISM IN IRELAND (1844)</h3>
<br>
<p>The great and all-present evil of the rural districts is
this--you have too many people for the work to be done, and you,
the landed proprietors, are alone responsible for this state of
things; and to speak honestly, I believe many of you know it. I
have been charged with saying out-of-doors that this House is a
club of land-owners legislating for land-owners. If I had not said
it, the public must long ago have found out that fact. My honorable
friend the member for Stockport on one occasion proposed that
before you passed a law to raise the price of bread, you should
consider how far you had the power to raise the rates of wages.
What did you say to that? You said that the laborers did not
understand political economy, or they would not apply to Parliament
to raise wages; that Parliament could not raise wages. And yet the
very next thing you did was to pass a law to raise the price of
produce of your own land, at the expense of the very class whose
wages you confessed your inability to increase.</p>
<p>What is the condition of the county of Suffolk? Is it not
notorious that the rents are as high as they were fifty years ago,
and probably much higher? But the return for the farmer's capital
is much lower, and the condition of the laborer is very much worse.
The farmers are subject to the law of competition, and rents are
thereby raised from time to time so as to keep their profits down
to the lowest point, and the laborers by the competition amongst
them are reduced to the point below which life cannot be
maintained. Your tenants and laborers are being devoured by this
excessive competition, whilst you, their magnanimous landlords,
shelter yourselves from all competition by the Corn Law yourselves
have passed, and make the competition of all other classes serve
still more to swell your rentals. It was for this object the Corn
Law was passed, and yet in the face of your countrymen you dare to
call it a law for the protection of native industry....</p>
<p>Again, a rural police is kept up by the gentry; the farmers say
for the sole use of watching game and frightening poachers, for
which formerly they had to pay watchers. Is this true, or is it
not? I say, then, you care everything for the rights--and for
something beyond the rights--of your own property, but you are
oblivious to its duties. How many lives have been sacrificed during
the past year to the childish infatuation of preserving game? The
noble lord, the member for North Lancashire, could tell of a
gamekeeper killed in an affray on his father's estate in that
county. For the offense one man was hanged, and four men are now on
their way to penal colonies. Six families are thus deprived of
husband and father, that this wretched system of game-preserving
may be continued in a country densely peopled as this is. The
Marquis of Normanby's gamekeeper has been murdered also, and the
poacher who shot him only escaped death by the intervention of the
Home Secretary. At Godalming, in Surrey, a gamekeeper has been
murdered; and at Buckhill, in Buckinghamshire, a person has
recently been killed in a poaching affray. This insane system is
the cause of a fearful loss of life; it tends to the ruin of your
tenantry, and is the fruitful cause of the demoralization of the
peasantry. But you are caring for the rights of property; for its
most obvious duties you have no concern. With such a policy, what
can you expect but that which is now passing before you?</p>
<p>It is the remark of a beautiful writer that "to have known
nothing but misery is the most portentous condition under which
human nature can start on its course." Has your agricultural
laborer ever known anything but misery? He is born in a miserable
hovel, which in mockery is termed a house or a home; he is reared
in penury: he passes a life of hopeless and unrequited toil, and
the jail or the union house is before him as the only asylum on
this side of the pauper's grave. Is this the result of your
protection to native industry? Have you cared for the laborer till,
from a home of comfort, he has but a hovel for shelter? and have
you cherished him into starvation and rags? I tell you what your
boasted protection is--it is a protection of native idleness at the
expense of the impoverishment of native industry.</p>

<h3>FROM THE SPEECH ON NON-RECOGNITION OF THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY
(1861)</h3>
<br>
<p>I advise you, and I advise the people of England, to abstain
from applying to the United States doctrines and principles which
we never apply to our own case. At any rate, they [the Americans]
have never fought "for the balance of power" in Europe. They have
never fought to keep up a decaying empire. They have never
squandered the money of their people in such a phantom expedition
as we have been engaged in. And now, at this moment, when you are
told that they are going to be ruined by their vast
expenditure,--why, the sum that they are going to raise in the
great emergency of this grievous war is not greater than what we
raise every year during a time of peace.</p>
<p>They say they are not going to liberate slaves. No; the object
of the Washington government is to maintain their own Constitution
and to act legally, as it permits and requires. No man is more in
favor of peace than I am; no man has denounced war more than I
have, probably, in this country; few men in their public life have
suffered more obloquy--I had almost said, more indignity--in
consequence of it. But I cannot for the life of me see, upon any of
those principles upon which States are governed now,--I say nothing
of the literal word of the New Testament,--I cannot see how the
state of affairs in America, with regard to the United States
government, could have been different from what it is at this
moment. We had a Heptarchy in this country, and it was thought to
be a good thing to get rid of it, and have a united nation. If the
thirty-three or thirty-four States of the American Union can break
off whenever they like, I can see nothing but disaster and
confusion throughout the whole of that continent. I say that the
war, be it successful or not, be it Christian or not, be it wise or
not, is a war to sustain the government and to sustain the
authority of a great nation; and that the people of England, if
they are true to their own sympathies, to their own history, and to
their own great act of 1834, to which reference has already been
made, will have no sympathy with those who wish to build up a great
empire on the perpetual bondage of millions of their
fellow-men.</p>
<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="BRIGHT04"></a>
<h3>FROM THE SPEECH ON THE STATE OF IRELAND (1866)</h3>
<br>
<p>I think I was told in 1849, as I stood in the burial ground at
Skibbereen, that at least four hundred people who had died of
famine were buried within the quarter of an acre of ground on which
I was then looking. It is a country, too, from which there has been
a greater emigration by sea within a given time than has been known
at any time from any other country in the world. It is a country
where there has been, for generations past, a general sense of
wrong, out of which has grown a chronic state of insurrection; and
at this very moment when I speak, the general safeguard of
constitutional liberty is withdrawn, and we meet in this hall, and
I speak here to-night, rather by the forbearance and permission of
the Irish executive than under the protection of the common
safeguards of the rights and liberties of the people of the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>I venture to say that this is a miserable and a humiliating
picture to draw of this country. Bear in mind that I am not
speaking of Poland suffering under the conquest of Russia. There is
a gentleman, now a candidate for an Irish county, who is very great
upon the wrongs of Poland; but I have found him always in the House
of Commons taking sides with that great party which has
systematically supported the wrongs of Ireland. I am not speaking
of Hungary, or of Venice as she was under the rule of Austria, or
of the Greeks under the dominion of the Turk; but I am speaking of
Ireland--part of the United Kingdom--part of that which boasts
itself to be the most civilized and the most Christian nation in
the world. I took the liberty recently, at a meeting in Glasgow, to
say that I believed it was impossible for a class to govern a great
nation wisely and justly. Now, in Ireland there has been a field in
which all the principles of the Tory party have had their complete
experiment and development. You have had the country gentleman in
all his power. You have had any number of Acts of Parliament which
the ancient Parliament of Ireland or the Parliament of the United
Kingdom could give him. You have had the Established Church
supported by the law, even to the extent, not many years ago, of
collecting its revenues by the aid of military force. In point of
fact, I believe it would be impossible to imagine a state of things
in which the Tory party should have a more entire and complete
opportunity for their trial than they have had within the limits of
this island. And yet what has happened? This, surely: that the
kingdom has been continually weakened, that the harmony of the
empire has been disturbed, and that the mischief has not been
confined to the United Kingdom, but has spread to the
colonies....</p>
<p>I am told--you can answer it if I am wrong--that it is not
common in Ireland now to give leases to tenants, especially to
Catholic tenants. If that be so, then the security for the property
rests only upon the good feeling and favor of the owner of the
land; for the laws, as we know, have been made by the land-owners,
and many propositions for the advantage of the tenants have
unfortunately been too little considered by Parliament. The result
is that you have bad farming, bad dwelling-houses, bad temper, and
everything bad connected with the occupation and cultivation of
land in Ireland. One of the results--a result the most
appalling--is this, that your population is fleeing your country
and seeking refuge in a distant land. On this point I wish to refer
to a letter which I received a few days ago from a most esteemed
citizen of Dublin. He told me that he believed that a very large
portion of what he called the poor, amongst Irishmen, sympathized
with any scheme or any proposition that was adverse to the Imperial
Government. He said further that the people here are rather in the
country than of it, and that they are looking more to America than
they are looking to England. I think there is a good deal in that.
When we consider how many Irishmen have found a refuge in America,
I do not know how we can wonder at that statement. You will
recollect that when the ancient Hebrew prophet prayed in his
captivity, he prayed with his window open towards Jerusalem. You
know that the followers of Mohammed, when they pray, turn their
faces towards Mecca. When the Irish peasant asks for food and
freedom and blessing, his eye follows the setting sun, the
aspirations of his heart reach beyond the wide Atlantic, and in
spirit he grasps hands with the great Republic of the West. If this
be so, I say then that the disease is not only serious, but it is
desperate; but desperate as it is, I believe there is a certain
remedy for it if the people and Parliament of the United Kingdom
are willing to apply it....</p>
<p>I believe that at the root of a general discontent there is in
all countries a general grievance and general suffering. The
surface of society is not incessantly disturbed without a cause. I
recollect in the poem of the greatest of Italian poets, he tells us
that as he saw in vision the Stygian lake, and stood upon its
banks, he observed the constant commotion upon the surface of the
pool, and his good instructor and guide explained to him the cause
of it:--</p>
<blockquote>"This, too, for certain know, that underneath<br>
The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs<br>
Into these bubbles make the surface heave,<br>
As thine eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turn."</blockquote>
<p>And I say that in Ireland, for generations back, the misery and
the wrongs of the people have made their sign, and have found a
voice in constant insurrection and disorder. I have said that
Ireland is a country of many wrongs and of many sorrows. Her past
lies almost in shadow. Her present is full of anxiety and peril.
Her future depends on the power of her people to substitute
equality and justice for supremacy, and a generous patriotism for
the spirit of faction. In the effort now making in Great Britain to
create a free representation of the people you have the deepest
interest. The people never wish to suffer, and they never wish to
inflict injustice. They have no sympathy with the wrong-doer,
whether in Great Britain or in Ireland; and when they are fairly
represented in the Imperial Parliament, as I hope they will one day
be, they will speedily give an effective and final answer to that
old question of the Parliament of Kilkenny--"How comes it to pass
that the King has never been the richer for Ireland?"</p>

<h3>FROM THE SPEECH ON THE IRISH ESTABLISHED CHURCH (1868)</h3>
<br>
<p>I am one of those who do not believe that the Established Church
of Ireland--of which I am not a member--would go to absolute ruin,
in the manner of which many of its friends are now so fearful.
There was a paper sent to me this morning, called 'An Address from
the Protestants of Ireland to their Protestant Brethren of Great
Britain.' It is dated "5, Dawson Street," and is signed by "John
Trant Hamilton, T.A. Lefroy, and R.W. Gamble." The paper is written
in a fair and mild, and I would even say,--for persons who have
these opinions,--in a kindly and just spirit. But they have been
alarmed, and I would wish, if I can, to offer them consolation.
They say they have no interest in protecting any abuses of the
Established Church, but they protest against their being now
deprived of the Church of their fathers. Now, I am quite of opinion
that it would be a most monstrous thing to deprive the Protestants
of the Church of their fathers; and there is no man in the world
who would more strenuously resist even any step in that direction
than I would, unless it were Mr. Gladstone, the author of the
famous resolutions. The next sentence goes on to say, "We ask for
no ascendancy." Having read that sentence, I think that we must
come to the conclusion that these gentlemen are in a better frame
of mind than we thought them to be in. I can understand easily that
these gentlemen are very sorry and doubtful as to the depths into
which they are to be plunged; but I disagree with them in
this--that I think there would still be a Protestant Church in
Ireland when all is done that Parliament has proposed to do. The
only difference will be, that it will not then be an
establishment--that it will have no special favor or grant from the
State--that it will stand in relation to the State just as your
Church does, and just as the churches of the majority of the people
of Great Britain at this moment stand. There will then be no
Protestant bishops from Ireland to sit in the House of Lords; but
he must be the most enthusiastic Protestant and Churchman who
believes that there can be any advantage to his Church and to
Protestantism generally in Ireland from such a phenomenon.</p>

<h2>BRILLAT-SAVARIN</h2>
<h3>(1755-1826)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-b.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>rillat-Savarin was a French magistrate and legislator, whose
reputation as man of letters rests mainly upon a single volume, his
inimitable 'Physiologie du Go&ucirc;t'. Although writing in the
present century, he was essentially a Frenchman of the old
r&eacute;gime, having been born in 1755 at Belley, almost on the
border-line of Savoy, where he afterwards gained distinction as an
advocate. In later life he regretted his native province chiefly
for its figpeckers, superior in his opinion to ortolans or robins,
and for the cuisine of the innkeeper Genin, where "the old-timers
of Belley used to gather to eat chestnuts and drink the new white
wine known as <i>vin bourru</i>"</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/bremer.jpg" width="45%" alt=""><br>
<b>Brillat-Savarin</b></p>
<p>After holding various minor offices in his department, Savarin
became mayor of Belley in 1793; but the Reign of Terror soon forced
him to flee to Switzerland and join the colony of French refugees
at Lausanne. Souvenirs of this period are frequent in his
'Physiologie du Go&ucirc;t', all eminently gastronomic, as befits
his subject-matter, but full of interest, as showing his unfailing
cheerfulness amidst the vicissitudes and privations of exile. He
fled first to D&ocirc;le, to "obtain from the Representative
Pr&ocirc;t a safe-conduct, which was to save me from going to
prison and thence probably to the scaffold," and which he
ultimately owed to Madame Pr&ocirc;t, with whom he spent the
evening playing duets, and who declared, "Citizen, any one who
cultivates the fine arts as you do cannot betray his country!" It
was not the safe-conduct, however, but an unexpected dinner which
he enjoyed on his route, that made this a red-letter day to
Savarin:--"What a good dinner!--I will not give the details, but an
honorable mention is due to a <i>fricass&eacute;e</i> of chicken,
of the first order, such as cannot be found except in the
provinces, and so richly dowered with truffles that there were
enough to put new life into old Tithonus himself."</p>
<p>The whole episode is told in Savarin's happiest vein, and
well-nigh justifies his somewhat complacent conclusion that "any
one who, with a revolutionary committee at his heels, could so
conduct himself, assuredly has the head and the heart of a
Frenchman!"</p>
<p>Natural scenery did not appeal to Savarin; to him Switzerland
meant the restaurant of the Lion d'Argent, at Lausanne, where "for
only 15 <i>batz</i> we passed in review three complete courses;"
the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> of the Rue de Rosny; and the little
village of Moudon, where the cheese <i>fondue</i> was so good.
Circumstances, however, soon necessitated his departure for the
United States, which he always gratefully remembered as having
afforded him "an asylum, employment, and tranquillity." For three
years he supported himself in New York, giving French lessons and
at night playing in a theatre orchestra. "I was so comfortable
there," he writes, "that in the moment of emotion which preceded
departure, all that I asked of Heaven (a prayer which it has
granted) was never to know greater sorrow in the Old World than I
had known in the New." Returning to France in 1796, Savarin settled
in Paris, and after holding several offices under the Directory,
became a Judge in the Cour de Cassation, the French court of last
resort, where he remained until his death in 1826.</p>
<p>Although an able and conscientious magistrate, Savarin was
better adapted to play the kindly friend and cordial host than the
stern and impartial judge. He was a convivial soul, a lover of good
cheer and free-handed hospitality; and to-day, while almost
forgotten as a jurist, his name has become immortalized as the
representative of gastronomic excellence. His 'Physiologic du
Go&ucirc;t'--"that <i>olla podrida</i> which defies analysis," as
Balzac calls it--belongs, like Walton's 'Compleat Angler', or
White's 'Selborne', among those unique gems of literature, too rare
in any age, which owe their subtle and imperishable charm primarily
to the author's own delightful personality. Savarin spent many
years of loving care in polishing his manuscript, often carrying it
to court with him, where it was one day mislaid, but--luckily for
future generations of epicures--was afterward recovered. The book
is a charming badinage, a bizarre rago&ucirc;t of gastronomic
precepts and spicy anecdote, doubly piquant for its prevailing tone
of mock seriousness and intentional grandiloquence.</p>
<p>In emulation of the poet Lamartine, Savarin divided his subject
into 'Meditations', of which the seventh is consecrated to the
'Theory of Frying', and the twenty-first to 'Corpulence'. In the
familiar aphorism, "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what
you are", he strikes his key-note; man's true superiority lies in
his palate! "The pleasure of eating we have in common with the
animals; the pleasure of the table is peculiar to the human
species." Gastronomy he proclaims the chief of all sciences: "It
rules life in its entirety; for the tears of the new-born infant
summon the breast of its nurse, and the dying man still receives
with some pleasure the final potion, which, alas, he is not
destined to digest." Occasionally he affects an epic strain,
invoking Gasteria, "the tenth muse, who presides over the pleasures
of taste." "It is the fairest of the Muses who inspires me: I will
be clearer than an oracle, and my precepts will traverse the
centuries." Beneath his pen, soup, "the first consolation of the
needy stomach," assumes fresh dignity; and even the humble fowl
becomes to the cook "what the canvas is to the painter, or the cap
of Fortunatus to the charlatan." But like the worthy epicure that
he was, Savarin reserved his highest flights of eloquence for such
rare and toothsome viands as the <i>Poularde fine de Bresse</i>,
the pheasant, "an enigma of which the key-word is known only to the
adepts," a <i>saut&eacute;</i> of truffles, "the diamonds of the
kitchen," or, best of all, truffled turkeys, "whose reputation and
price are ever on the increase! Benign stars, whose apparition
renders the gourmands of every category sparkling, radiant, and
quivering!" But the true charm of the book lies in Savarin's
endless fund of piquant anecdotes, reminiscences of bygone feasts,
over which the reader's mouth waters. Who can read without a
covetous pang his account of 'The Day at Home with the Bernadins,'
or of his entertainment of the Dubois brothers, of the <i>Rue du
Bac</i>, "a bonbon which I have put into the reader's mouth to
recompense him for his kindness in having read me with
pleasure"?</p>
<p>'Physiologic du Go&ucirc;t' was not published until 1825, and
then anonymously, presumably because he thought its tone
inconsistent with his dignity as magistrate. It would almost seem
that he had a presentiment of impending death, for in the midst of
his brightest 'Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s' he has incongruously
inserted a dolorous little poem, the burden of each verse being "Je
vais mourir." The 'Physiologic du Go&ucirc;t' is now accessible to
English readers in the versions of R.E. Anderson (London, 1877),
and in a later one published in New York; but there is a subtle
flavor to the original which defies translation.</p>

<h2>FROM THE 'PHYSIOLOGY OF TASTE'</h2>
<h3>THE PRIVATIONS</h3>
<br>
<p>First parents of the human species, whose gormandizing is
historic, you who fell for the sake of an apple, what would you not
have done for a turkey with truffles? But there were in the
terrestrial Paradise neither cooks nor confectioners.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Mighty kings, who laid proud Troy in ruins, your valor will be
handed down from age to age; but your table was poor. Reduced to a
rump of beef and a chine of pork, you were ever ignorant of the
charms of the <i>matelote</i> and the delights of a
fricass&eacute;e of chicken.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Aspasia, Chloe, and all of you whose forms the chisel of the
Greeks immortalized, to the despair of the belles of to-day, never
did your charming mouths enjoy the smoothness of a meringue
<i>&agrave; la vanille</i> or <i>&agrave; la rose</i>; hardly did
you rise to the height of a spice-cake.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Gentle priestesses of Vesta, at one and the same time burdened
with so many honors and menaced with such horrible punishments,
would that you might at least have tasted those agreeable syrups
which refresh the soul, those candied fruits which brave the
seasons, those perfumed creams, the marvel of our day!</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Roman financiers, who made the whole known universe pay tribute,
never did your far-famed banquet-halls witness the appearance of
those succulent jellies, the delight of the indolent, nor those
varied ices whose cold would brave the torrid zone.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Invincible paladins, celebrated by flattering minstrels, when
you had cleft in twain the giants, set free the ladies, and
exterminated armies, never, alas! never did a dark-eyed captive
offer you the sparkling champagne, the malmsey of Madeira, the
liqueurs, creation of this great century: you were reduced to ale
or to some cheap herb-flavored wine.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Crosiered and mitred abbots, dispensers of the favors of heaven;
and you, terrible Templars, who donned your armor for the
extermination of the Saracens,--you knew not the sweetness of
chocolate which restores, nor the Arabian bean which promotes
thought.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>Superb ch&acirc;telaines, who during the loneliness of the
Crusades raised into highest favor your chaplains and your pages,
you never could share with them the charms of the biscuit and the
delights of the macaroon.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>
<p>And lastly you, gastronomers of 1825, who already find satiety
in the lap of abundance, and dream of new preparations, you will
not enjoy those discoveries which the sciences have in store for
the year 1900, such as esculent minerals and liqueurs resulting
from a pressure of a hundred atmospheres; you will not behold the
importations which travelers yet unborn shall cause to arrive from
that half of the globe which still remains to be discovered or
explored.</p>
<p>How I pity you!</p>

<h3>ON THE LOVE OF GOOD LIVING</h3>
<br>
<p>I have consulted the dictionaries under the word
<i>gourmandise</i>, and am by no means satisfied with what I find.
The love of good living seems to be constantly confounded with
gluttony and voracity; whence I infer that our lexicographers,
however otherwise estimable, are not to be classed with those good
fellows amongst learned men who can put away gracefully a wing of
partridge, and then, by raising the little finger, wash it down
with a glass of Lafitte or Clos-Vougeot.</p>
<p>They have utterly forgot that social love of good eating which
combines in one, Athenian elegance, Roman luxury, and Parisian
refinement. It implies discretion to arrange, skill to prepare; it
appreciates energetically, and judges profoundly. It is a precious
quality, almost deserving to rank as a virtue, and is very
certainly the source of much unqualified enjoyment.</p>
<p><i>Gourmandise</i>, or the love of good living, is an
impassioned, rational, and habitual preference for whatever
flatters the sense of taste. It is opposed to excess; therefore
every man who eats to indigestion, or makes himself drunk, runs the
risk of being erased from the list of its votaries.
<i>Gourmandise</i> also comprises a love for dainties or tit-bits;
which is merely an analogous preference, limited to light,
delicate, or small dishes, to pastry, and so forth. It is a
modification allowed in favor of the women, or men of feminine
tastes.</p>
<p>Regarded from any point of view, the love of good living
deserves nothing but praise and encouragement. Physically, it is
the result and proof of the digestive organs being healthy and
perfect. Morally, it shows implicit resignation to the commands of
Nature, who, in ordering man to eat that he may live, gives him
appetite to invite, flavor to encourage, and pleasure to
reward.</p>
<p>From the political economist's point of view, the love of good
living is a tie between nations, uniting them by the interchange of
various articles of food which are in constant use. Hence the
voyage from Pole to Pole of wines, sugars, fruits, and so forth.
What else sustains the hope and emulation of that crowd of
fishermen, huntsmen, gardeners, and others who daily stock the most
sumptuous larders with the results of their skill and labor? What
else supports the industrious army of cooks, pastry-cooks,
confectioners, and many other food-preparers, with all their
various assistants? These various branches of industry derive their
support in a great measure from the largest incomes, but they also
rely upon the daily wants of all classes.</p>
<p>As society is at present constituted, it is almost impossible to
conceive of a race living solely on bread and vegetables. Such a
nation would infallibly be conquered by the armies of some
flesh-eating race (like the Hindoos, who have been the prey of all
those, one after another, who cared to attack them), or else it
would be converted by the cooking of the neighboring nations, as
ancient history records of the Boeotians, who acquired a love for
good living after the battle of Leuctra.</p>
<p>Good living opens out great resources for replenishing the
public purse: it brings contributions to town-dues, to the
custom-house, and other indirect contributions. Everything we eat
is taxed, and there is no exchequer that is not substantially
supported by lovers of good living. Shall we speak of that swarm of
cooks who have for ages been annually leaving France, to improve
foreign nations in the art of good living? Most of them succeed;
and in obedience to an instinct which never dies in a Frenchman's
heart, bring back to their country the fruits of their economy. The
sum thus imported is greater than might be supposed, and therefore
they, like the others, will be honored by posterity.</p>
<p>But if nations were grateful, then Frenchmen, above all other
races, ought to raise a temple and altars to "Gourmandise." By the
treaty of November, 1815, the allies imposed upon France the
condition of paying thirty millions sterling in three years,
besides claims for compensation and various requisitions, amounting
to nearly as much more. The apprehension, or rather certainty,
became general that a national bankruptcy must ensue, more
especially as the money was to be paid in specie.</p>
<p>"Alas!" said all who had anything to lose, as they saw the fatal
tumbril pass to be filled in the Rue Vivienne, "there is our money
emigrating in a lump; next year we shall fall on our knees before a
crown-piece; we are about to fall into the condition of a ruined
man; speculations of every kind will fail; it will be impossible to
borrow; there will be nothing but weakness, exhaustion, civil
death."</p>
<p>These terrors were proved false by the result; and to the great
astonishment of all engaged in financial matters, the payments were
made without difficulty, credit rose, loans were eagerly caught at,
and during all the time this "superpurgation" lasted, the balance
of exchange was in favor of France. In other words, more money came
into the country than went out of it.</p>
<p>What is the power that came to our assistance? Who is the
divinity that worked this miracle? The love of good living.</p>
<p>When the Britons, Germans, Teutons, Cimmerians, and Scythians
made their irruption into France, they brought a rare voracity, and
stomachs of no ordinary capacity. They did not long remain
satisfied with the official cheer which a forced hospitality had to
supply them with. They aspired to enjoyments of greater refinement;
and soon the Queen City was nothing but a huge refectory.
Everywhere they were seen eating, those intruders--in the
restaurants, the eating-houses, the inns, the taverns, the stalls,
and even in the streets. They gorged themselves with flesh, fish,
game, truffles, pastry, and especially with fruit. They drank with
an avidity equal to their appetite, and always ordered the most
expensive wines, in the hope of finding in them some enjoyment
hitherto unknown, and seemed quite astonished when they were
disappointed. Superficial observers did not know what to think of
this menagerie without bounds or limits; but your genuine Parisian
laughed and rubbed his hands. "We have them now!" said he; "and
to-night they'll have paid us back more than was counted out to
them this morning from the public treasury!"</p>
<p>That was a lucky time for those who provide for the enjoyments
of the sense of taste. V&eacute;ry made his fortune; Achard laid
the foundation of his; Beauvilliers made a third; and Madame
Sullot, whose shop in the Palais Royal was a mere box of a place,
sold as many as twelve thousand tarts a day.</p>
<p>The effect still lasts. Foreigners flow in from all quarters of
Europe to renew during peace the delightful habits which they
contracted during the war. They must come to Paris, and when they
are there, they must be regaled at any price. If our funds are in
favor, it is due not so much to the higher interest they pay, as to
the instinctive confidence which foreigners cannot help placing in
a people amongst whom every lover of good living finds so much
happiness.</p>
<p>Love of good living is by no means unbecoming in women. It
agrees with the delicacy of their organization, and serves as a
compensation for some pleasures which they are obliged to abstain
from, and for some hardships to which nature seems to have
condemned them. There is no more pleasant sight than a pretty
<i>gourmande</i> under arms. Her napkin is nicely adjusted; one of
her hands rests on the table, the other carries to her mouth little
morsels artistically carved, or the wing of a partridge which must
be picked. Her eyes sparkle, her lips are glossy, her talk is
cheerful, all her movements graceful; nor is there lacking some
spice of the coquetry which accompanies all that women do. With so
many advantages, she is irresistible, and Cato the Censor himself
could not help yielding to the influence.</p>
<p>The love of good living is in some sort instinctive in women,
because it is favorable to beauty. It has been proved, by a series
of rigorously exact observations, that by a succulent, delicate,
and choice regimen, the external appearances of age are kept away
for a long time. It gives more brilliancy to the eye, more
freshness to the skin, more support to the muscles; and as it is
certain in physiology that wrinkles, those formidable enemies of
beauty, are caused by the depression of muscle, it is equally true
that, other things being equal, those who understand eating are
comparatively four years younger than those ignorant of that
science. Painters and sculptors are deeply impenetrated with this
truth; for in representing those who practice abstinence by choice
or duty as misers or anchorites, they always give them the pallor
of disease, the leanness of misery, and the wrinkles of
decrepitude.</p>
<p>Good living is one of the main links of society, by gradually
extending that spirit of conviviality by which different classes
are daily brought closer together and welded into one whole; by
animating the conversation, and rounding off the angles of
conventional inequality. To the same cause we can also ascribe all
the efforts a host makes to receive his guests properly, as well as
their gratitude for his pains so well bestowed. What disgrace
should ever be heaped upon those senseless feeders who, with
unpardonable indifference, swallow down morsels of the rarest
quality, or gulp with unrighteous carelessness some fine-flavored
and sparkling wine.</p>
<p>As a general maxim: Whoever shows a desire to please will be
certain of having a delicate compliment paid him by every well-bred
man.</p>
<p>Again, when shared, the love of good living has the most marked
influence on the happiness of the conjugal state. A wedded pair
with this taste in common have once a day at least a pleasant
opportunity of meeting. For even when they sleep apart (and a great
many do so), they at least eat at the same table, they have a
subject of conversation which is ever new, they speak not only of
what they are eating, but also of what they have eaten or will eat,
of dishes which are in vogue, of novelties, etc. Everybody knows
that a familiar chat is delightful.</p>
<p>Music, no doubt, has powerful attractions for those who are fond
of it, but one must set about it--it is an exertion. Besides, one
sometimes has a cold, the music is mislaid, the instruments are out
of tune, one has a fit of the blues, or it is a forbidden day.
Whereas, in the other case, a common want summons the spouses to
table, the same inclination keeps them there; they naturally show
each other these little attentions as a proof of their wish to
oblige, and the mode of conducting their meals has a great share in
the happiness of their lives.</p>
<p>This observation, though new in France, has not escaped the
notice of Richardson, the English moralist. He has worked out the
idea in his novel 'Pamela,' by painting the different manner in
which two married couples finish their day. The first husband is a
lord, an eldest son, and therefore heir to all the family property;
the second is his younger brother, the husband of Pamela, who has
been disinherited on account of his marriage, and lives on half-pay
in a state but little removed from abject poverty.</p>
<p>The lord and lady enter their dining-room by different doors,
and salute each other coldly, though they have not met the whole
day before. Sitting down at a table which is magnificently covered,
surrounded by lackeys in brilliant liveries, they help themselves
in silence, and eat without pleasure. As soon, however, as the
servants have withdrawn, a sort of conversation is begun between
the pair, which quickly shows a bitter tone, passing into a regular
fight, and they rise from the table in a fury of anger, and go off
to their separate apartments to reflect upon the pleasures of a
single life.</p>
<p>The younger brother, on the contrary, is, on reaching his
unpretentious home, received with a gentle, loving heartiness and
the fondest caresses. He sits down to a frugal meal, but everything
he eats is excellent; and how could it be otherwise? It is Pamela
herself who has prepared it all. They eat with enjoyment, talking
of their affairs, their plans, their love for each other. A
half-bottle of Madeira serves to prolong their repast and
conversation, and soon after they retire together, to forget in
sleep their present hardships, and to dream of a better future.</p>
<p>All honor to the love of good living, such as it is the purpose
of this book to describe, so long as it does not come between men
and their occupations or duties! For, as all the debaucheries of a
Sardanapalus cannot bring disrespect upon womankind in general, so
the excesses of a Vitellius need not make us turn our backs upon a
well-appointed banquet. Should the love of good living pass into
gluttony, voracity, intemperance, it then loses its name and
advantages, escapes from our jurisdiction, and falls within that of
the moralist to ply it with good counsel, or of the physician who
will cure it by his remedies.</p>

<a name="BRILLAT03"></a>
<h3>ON PEOPLE FOND OF GOOD LIVING</h3>
<br>
<p>There are individuals to whom nature has denied a refinement of
organs, or a continuity of attention, without which the most
succulent dishes pass unobserved. Physiology has already recognized
the first of these varieties, by showing us the tongue of these
unhappy ones, badly furnished with nerves for inhaling and
appreciating flavors. These excite in them but an obtuse sentiment;
such persons are, with regard to objects of taste, what the blind
are with regard to light. The second class are the absent-minded,
chatterboxes, persons engrossed in business or ambition, and others
who seek to occupy themselves with two things at once, and eat only
to be filled. Such, for example, was Napoleon; he was irregular in
his meals, and ate fast and badly. But there again was to be traced
that absolute will which he carried into everything he did. The
moment appetite was felt, it was necessary that it should be
satisfied; and his establishment was so arranged that, in any place
and at any hour, chicken, cutlets, and coffee might be forthcoming
at a word.</p>
<p>There is a privileged class of persons who are summoned to the
enjoyments of taste by a physical and organic predisposition. I
have always believed in physiognomy and phrenology. Men have inborn
tendencies; and since there are some who come into the world
seeing, hearing, and walking badly, because they are short-sighted,
deaf, or crippled, why should there not be others who are specially
predisposed to experience a certain series of sensations? Moreover,
even an ordinary observer will constantly discover faces which bear
the unmistakable imprint of a ruling passion--such as
superciliousness, self-satisfaction, misanthropy, sensuality, and
many others. Sometimes, no doubt, we meet with a face that
expresses nothing; but when the physiognomy has a marked stamp it
is almost always a true index. The passions act upon the muscles,
and frequently, although a man says nothing, the various feelings
by which he is moved can be read in his face. By this tension, if
in the slightest degree habitual, perceptible traces are at last
left, and the physiognomy thus assumes its permanent and
recognizable characteristics.</p>
<p>Those predisposed to epicurism are for the most part of middling
height. They are broad-faced, and have bright eyes, small forehead,
short nose, fleshy lips, and rounded chin. The women are plump,
chubby, pretty rather than beautiful, with a slight tendency to
fullness of figure. It is under such an exterior that we must look
for agreeable guests. They accept all that is offered them, eat
without hurry, and taste with discrimination. They never make any
haste to get away from houses where they have been well treated,
but stay for the evening, because they know all the games and other
after-dinner amusements.</p>
<p>Those, on the contrary, to whom nature has denied an aptitude
for the enjoyments of taste, are long-faced, long-nosed, and
long-eyed: whatever their stature, they have something lanky about
them. They have dark, lanky hair, and are never in good condition.
It was one of them who invented trousers. The women whom nature has
afflicted with the same misfortune are angular, feel themselves
bored at table, and live on cards and scandal.</p>
<p>This theory of mine can be verified by each reader from his own
personal observation. I shall give an instance from my own personal
experience:--</p>
<p>Sitting one day at a grand banquet, I had opposite me a very
pretty neighbor, whose face showed the predisposition I have
described. Leaning to the guest beside me, I said quietly that from
her physiognomy, the young lady on the other side of the table must
be fond of good eating. "You must be mad!" he answered; "she is but
fifteen at most, which is certainly not the age for such a thing.
However, let us watch."</p>
<p>At first, things were by no means in my favor, and I was
somewhat afraid of having compromised myself, for during the first
two courses the young lady quite astonished me by her discretion,
and I suspected we had stumbled upon an exception, remembering that
there are some for every rule. But at last the dessert came,--a
dessert both magnificent and abundant,--and my hopes were again
revived. Nor did I hope in vain: not only did she eat of all that
was offered her, but she even got dishes brought to her from the
farthest parts of the table. In a word, she tasted everything, and
my neighbor at last expressed his astonishment that the little
stomach could hold so many things. Thus was my diagnosis verified,
and once again science triumphed.</p>
<p>Whilst I was writing the above, on a fine winter's evening, M.
Cartier, formerly the first violinist at the Opera, paid me a
visit, and sat down at the fireside. Being full of my subject, I
said, after looking at him attentively for some time, "How does it
happen, my dear professor, that you are no epicure, when you have
all the features of one?" "I was one," he replied, "and among the
foremost; but now I refrain." "On principle, I suppose?" said I;
but all the answer I had was a sigh, like one of Sir Walter
Scott's--that is to say, almost a groan.</p>
<p>As some are gourmands by predestination, so others become so by
their state in society or their calling. There are four classes
which I should signalize by way of eminence: the moneyed class, the
doctors, men of letters, and the devout.</p>
<p>Inequality of condition implies inequality of wealth, but
inequality of wealth does not imply inequality of wants; and he who
can afford every day a dinner sufficient for a hundred persons is
often satisfied by eating the thigh of a chicken. Hence the
necessity for the many devices of art to reanimate that ghost of an
appetite by dishes which maintain it without injury, and caress
without stifling it.</p>
<p>The causes which act upon doctors are very different, though not
less powerful. They become epicures in spite of themselves, and
must be made of bronze to resist the seductive power of
circumstances. The "dear doctor" is all the more kindly welcomed
that health is the most precious of boons; and thus they are always
waited for with impatience and received with eagerness. Some are
kind to them from hope, others from gratitude. They are fed like
pet pigeons. They let things take their course, and in six months
the habit is confirmed, and they are gourmands past redemption.</p>
<p>I ventured one day to express this opinion at a banquet in
which, with eight others, I took a part, with Dr. Corvisart at the
head of the table. It was about the year 1806.</p>
<p>"You!" cried I, with the inspired tone of a Puritan preacher;
"you are the last remnant of a body which formerly covered the
whole of France. Alas! its members are annihilated or widely
scattered. No more <i>fermiers-g&eacute;n&eacute;raux</i>, no
abb&eacute;s nor knights nor white-coated friars. The members of
your profession constitute the whole gastronomic body. Sustain with
firmness that great responsibility, even if you must share the fate
of the three hundred Spartans at the Pass of Thermopylae."</p>
<p>At the same dinner I observed the following noteworthy fact. The
doctor, who, when in the mood, was a most agreeable companion,
drank nothing but iced champagne; and therefore in the earlier part
of the dinner, whilst others were engaged in eating, he kept
talking loudly and telling stories. But at dessert, on the
contrary, and when the general conversation began to be lively, he
became serious, silent, and sometimes low-spirited.</p>
<p>From this observation, confirmed by many others, I have deduced
the following theorem:--"Champagne, though at first exhilarating,
ultimately produces stupefying effects;" a result, moreover, which
is a well-known characteristic of the carbonic acid which it
contains.</p>
<p>Whilst I have the university doctors under my grasp, I must,
before I die, reproach them with the extreme severity which they
use towards their patients. As soon as one has the misfortune to
fall into their hands, he must undergo a whole litany of
prohibitions, and give up everything that he is accustomed to think
agreeable. I rise up to oppose such interdictions, as being for the
most part useless. I say useless, because the patient never longs
for what is hurtful. A doctor of judgment will never lose sight of
the instinctive tendency of our inclinations, or forget that if
painful sensations are naturally fraught with danger, those which
are pleasant have a healthy tendency. We have seen a drop of wine,
a cup of coffee, or a thimbleful of liqueur, call up a smile to the
most Hippocratic face.</p>
<p>Those severe prescribers must, moreover, know very well that
their prescriptions remain almost always without result. The
patient tries to evade the duty of taking them; those about him
easily find a good excuse for humoring him, and thus his death is
neither hastened nor retarded. In 1815 the medical allowance of a
sick Russian would have made a drayman drunk, and that of an
Englishman was enough for a Limousin. Nor was any diminution
possible, for there were military inspectors constantly going round
our hospitals to examine the supply and the consumption.</p>
<p>I am the more confident in announcing my opinion because it is
based upon numerous facts, and the most successful practitioners
have used a system closely resembling it.</p>
<p>Canon Rollet, who died some fifty years ago, was a hard drinker,
according to the custom of those days. He fell ill, and the
doctor's first words were a prohibition of wine in any form. On his
very next visit, however, our physician found beside the bed of his
patient the <i>corpus delicti</i> itself, to wit, a table covered
with a snow-white cloth, a crystal cup, a handsome-looking bottle,
and a napkin to wipe the lips. At this sight he flew into a violent
passion and spoke of leaving the house, when the wretched canon
cried to him in tones of lamentation, "Ah, doctor, remember that in
forbidding me to drink, you have not forbidden me the pleasure of
looking at the bottle!"</p>
<p>The physician who treated Montlusin of Pont de Veyle was still
more severe, for not only did he forbid the use of wine to his
patient, but also prescribed large doses of water. Shortly after
the doctor's departure, Madame Montlusin, anxious to give full
effect to the medical orders and assist in the recovery of her
husband's health, offered him a large glass of the finest and
clearest water. The patient took it with docility, and began to
drink it with resignation; but stopping short at the first
mouthful, he handed back the glass to his wife. "Take it, my dear,"
said he, "and keep it for another time; I have always heard it said
that we should not trifle with remedies."</p>
<p>In the domain of gastronomy the men of letters are near
neighbors to the doctors. A hundred years ago literary men were all
hard drinkers. They followed the fashion, and the memoirs of the
period are quite edifying on that subject. At the present day they
are gastronomes, and it is a step in the right direction. I by no
means agree with the cynical Geoffroy, who used to say that if our
modern writings are weak, it is because literary men now drink
nothing stronger than lemonade. The present age is rich in talents,
and the very number of books probably interferes with their proper
appreciation; but posterity, being more calm and judicial, will see
amongst them much to admire, just as we ourselves have done justice
to the masterpieces of Racine and Moli&egrave;re, which were
received by their contemporaries with coldness.</p>
<p>Never has the social position of men of letters been more
pleasant than at present. They no longer live in wretched garrets;
the fields of literature are become more fertile, and even the
study of the Muses has become productive. Received on an equality
in any rank of life, they no longer wait for patronage; and to fill
up their cup of happiness, good living bestows upon them its
dearest favors. Men of letters are invited because of the good
opinion men have of their talents; because their conversation has,
generally speaking, something piquant in it, and also because now
every dinner-party must as a matter of course have its literary
man.</p>
<p>Those gentlemen always arrive a little late, but are welcomed,
because expected. They are treated as favorites so that they may
come again, and regaled that they may shine; and as they find all
this very natural, by being accustomed to it they become, are, and
remain gastronomes.</p>
<p>Finally, amongst the most faithful in the ranks of gastronomy we
must reckon many of the devout--i.e., those spoken of by Louis XIV.
and Moli&egrave;re, whose religion consists in outward
show;--nothing to do with those who are really pious and
charitable.</p>
<p>Let us consider how this comes about. Of those who wish to
secure their salvation, the greater number try to find the most
pleasant road. Men who flee from society, sleep on the ground, and
wear hair-cloth next the skin, have always been, and must ever be,
exceptions. Now there are certain things unquestionably to be
condemned, and on no account to be indulged in--as balls, theatres,
gambling, and other similar amusements; and whilst they and all
that practice them are to be hated, good living presents itself
insinuatingly in a thoroughly orthodox guise.</p>
<p>By right divine, man is king of nature, and all that the earth
produces was created for him. It is for him that the quail is
fattened, for him that Mocha possesses so agreeable an aroma, for
him that sugar has such wholesome properties. How then neglect to
use, within reasonable limits, the good things which Providence
presents to us; especially if we continue to regard them as things
that perish with the using, especially if they raise our
thankfulness towards the Author of all!</p>
<p>Other equally strong reasons come to strengthen these. Can we be
too hospitable in receiving those who have charge of our souls, and
keep us in the way of safety? Should those meetings with so
excellent an object not be made pleasant, and therefore
frequent?</p>
<p>Sometimes, also, the gifts of Comus arrive unsought--perhaps a
souvenir of college days, a present from an old friend, a
peace-offering from a penitent or a college chum recalling himself
to one's memory. How refuse to accept such offerings, or to make
systematic use of them? It is simply a necessity.</p>
<p>The monasteries were real magazines of charming dainties, which
is one reason why certain connoisseurs so bitterly regret them.
Several of the monastic orders, especially that of St. Bernard,
made a profession of good cheer. The limits of gastronomic art have
been extended by the cooks of the clergy, and when M. de Pressigni
(afterwards Archbishop of Besan&ccedil;on) returned from the
Conclave at the election of Pius VI., he said that the best dinner
he had had in Rome was at the table of the head of the
Capuchins.</p>
<p>We cannot conclude this article better than by honorably
mentioning two classes of men whom we have seen in all their glory,
and whom the Revolution has eclipsed--the chevaliers and the
abb&eacute;s. How they enjoyed good living, those dear old fellows!
That could be told at a glance by their nervous nostrils, their
clear eyes, their moist lips and mobile tongues. Each class had at
the same time its own special manner of eating: the chevalier
having something military and dignified in his air and attitude;
while the abb&eacute; gathered himself together, as it were, to be
nearer his plate, with his right hand curved inward like the paw of
a cat drawing chestnuts from the fire, whilst in every feature was
shown enjoyment and an indefinable look of close attention.</p>
<p>So far from good living being hurtful to health, it has been
arithmetically proved by Dr. Villerm&eacute; in an able paper read
before the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences, that other things being
equal, the gourmands live longer than ordinary men.</p>

<h2>CHARLOTTE BRONT&Eacute; AND HER SISTERS</h2>
<h3>(1816-1855)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he least that can be said of Charlotte Bront&eacute; is that she
is a unique figure in literature. Nowhere else do we find another
personality combining such extraordinary qualities of mind and
heart,--qualities strangely contrasted, but still more strangely
harmonized. At times they are baffling, but always fascinating.
Nowhere else do we find so intimate an association of the
personality of the author with the work, so thorough an
identification with it of the author's life, even to the smaller
details. So true is this in the case of Charlotte Bront&eacute;
that the four novels 'Jane Eyre,' 'Shirley,' 'Villette,' and 'The
Professor' might with some justice be termed 'Charlotte
Bront&eacute;; her life and her friends.' Her works were in large
part an expression of herself; at times the best expression of
herself--of her actual self in experience and of her spiritual self
in travail and in aspiration. It is manifestly impossible therefore
to consider the works of Charlotte Bront&eacute; with justice apart
from herself. A correct understanding of her books can be obtained
only from a study of her remarkable personality and of the sad
circumstances of her life.</p>
<p>Public interest in Charlotte Bront&eacute; was first roused in
1847. In October of that year there appeared in London a novel that
created a sensation, the like of which had not been known since the
publication of 'Waverley.' Its stern and paradoxical disregard for
the conventional, its masculine energy, and its intense realism,
startled the public, and proclaimed to all in accents unmistakable
that a new, strange, and splendid power had come into literature,
"but yet a woman."</p>
<p>And with the success of 'Jane Eyre' came a lively curiosity to
know something of the personality of the author. This was not
gratified for some time. There were many conjectures, all of them
far amiss. The majority of readers asserted confidently that the
work must be that of a man; the touch was unmistakably masculine.
In some quarters it met with hearty abuse. The Quarterly Review, in
an article still notorious for its brutality, condemned the book as
coarse, and stated that if 'Jane Eyre' were really written by a
woman, she must be an improper woman, who had forfeited the society
of her sex. This was said in December, 1848, of one of the noblest
and purest of womankind. It is not a matter of surprise that the
identity of this audacious speculator was not revealed. The recent
examination into the topic by Mr. Clement Shorter seems, however,
to fix the authorship of the notice on Lady Eastlake, at that time
Miss Driggs.</p>
<p>But hostile criticism of the book and its mysterious author
could not injure its popularity. The story swept all before
it--press and public. Whatever might be the source, the work stood
there and spoke for itself in commanding terms. At length the
mystery was cleared. A shrewd Yorkshireman guessed and published
the truth, and the curious world knew that the author of 'Jane
Eyre' was the daughter of a clergyman in the little village of
Haworth, and that the literary sensation of the day found its
source in a nervous, shrinking, awkward, plain, delicate young
creature of thirty-one years of age, whose life, with the exception
of two years, had been spent on the bleak and dreary moorlands of
Yorkshire, and for the most part in the narrow confines of a grim
gray stone parsonage. There she had lived a pinched and meagre
little life, full of sadness and self-denial, with two sisters more
delicate than herself, a dissolute brother, and a father her only
parent,--a stern and forbidding father. This was no genial
environment for an author, even if helpful to her vivid
imagination. Nor was it a temporary condition; it was a permanent
one. Nearly all the influences in Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s life
were such as these, which would seem to cramp if not to stifle
sensitive talent. Her brother Branwell (physically weaker than
herself, though unquestionably talented, and for a time the idol
and hope of the family) became dissipated, irresponsible,
untruthful, and a ne'er-do-weel, and finally yielding to
circumstances, ended miserably a life of failure.</p>
<p>But Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s nature was one of indomitable
courage, that circumstances might shadow but could not obscure. Out
of the meagre elements of her narrow life she evolved works that
stand among the imperishable things of English literature. It is a
paradox that finds its explanation only in a statement of natural
sources, primitive, bardic, the sources of the early epics, the
sources of such epics as C&aelig;dmon and Beowulf bore. She wrote
from a sort of necessity; it was in obedience to the commanding
authority of an extraordinary genius,--a creative power that
struggled for expression,--and much of her work deserves in the
best and fullest sense the term "inspired."</p>
<br>
<a name="bronte.jpg"></a>
<p class="ctr"><a href="images/bronte.jpg"><img src=
"images/bronte.jpg" width="45%" alt=""></a></p>
<br>
<p>The facts of her life are few in number, but they have a direct
and significant bearing on her work. She was born at Thornton, in
the parish of Bradford, in 1816. Four years later her father moved
to Haworth, to the parsonage now indissolubly associated with her
name, and there Mr. Bront&eacute; entered upon a long period of
pastorate service, that only ended with his death. Charlotte's
mother was dead. In 1824 Charlotte and two older sisters, Maria and
Elizabeth, went to a school at Cowan's Bridge. It was an
institution for clergymen's children, a vivid picture of which
appears in 'Jane Eyre.' It was so badly managed and the food was so
poor that many of the children fell sick, among them Maria
Bront&eacute;, who died in 1825. Elizabeth followed her a few
months later, and Charlotte returned to Haworth, where she remained
for six years, then went to school at Roe Head for a period of
three years. She was offered the position of teacher by Miss
Wooler, the principal at Roe Head, but considering herself unfit to
teach, she resolved to go to Brussels to study French. She spent
two years there, and it was there that her intimate and
misconstrued friendship for M. Heger developed. The incidents of
that period formed the material of a greater portion of her novel
'Villette,' filled twenty-two volumes of from sixty to one hundred
pages of fine writing, and consisted of some forty complete
novelettes or other stories and childish "magazines."</p>
<p>On returning to Haworth, she endeavored, together with her
sister Emily, to establish a school at their home. But pupils were
not to be had, and the outlook was discouraging. Two periods of
service as governess, and the ill health that had followed, had
taught Charlotte the danger that threatened her. Her experiences as
a governess in the Sedgwick family were pictured by-and-by in 'Jane
Eyre.' In a letter to Miss Ellen Nussey, written at this time, she
gives a dark vignette of her situation.</p>
<p>With her two sisters Emily and Anne she lived a quiet and
retired life. The harsh realities about them, the rough natures of
the Yorkshire people, impelled the three sisters to construct in
their home an ideal world of their own, and in this their pent-up
natures found expression. Their home was lonely and gloomy. Mr.
Clement K. Shorter, in his recent study of the novelist and her
family, says that the house is much the same to-day, though its
immediate surroundings are brightened. He writes:</p>
<p>"One day Emily confided to Charlotte that she had written some
verses. Charlotte answered with a similar confidence, and then Anne
acknowledged that she too had been secretly writing. This mutual
confession brought about a complete understanding and sympathy, and
from that time on the sisters worked together--reading their
literary productions to one another and submitting to each other's
criticism."</p>
<p>This was however by no means Charlotte's first literary work.
She has left a catalogue of books written by her between 1829 and
1830. Her first printed work however appeared in a volume of
'Poems' by Acton, Ellis, and Currer Bell, published in 1846 at the
expense of the authors. Under these names the little book of the
Bront&eacute; sisters went forth to the world, was reviewed with
mild favor in some few periodicals, and was lost to sight.</p>
<p>Then came a period of novel-writing. As a result, Emily
Bront&eacute;'s 'Wuthering Heights,' Anne Bront&eacute;'s 'Agnes
Grey,' and Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s 'The Professor' set out
together to find a publisher. The last-named was unsuccessful; but
on the day it was returned to her, Charlotte Bront&eacute; began
writing 'Jane Eyre.' That first masterpiece was shaped during a
period of sorrow and discouragement. Her father was ill and in
danger of losing his eyesight. Her brother Bran well was sinking
into the slough of disgrace. No wonder 'Jane Eyre' is not a story
of sunshine and roses. She finished the story in 1847, and it was
accepted by the publishers promptly upon examination.</p>
<p>After its publication and the sensation produced, Charlotte
Bront&eacute; continued her literary work quietly, and unaffected
by the furore she had aroused. A few brief visits to London, where
attempts were made to lionize her,--very much to her distaste,--a
few literary friendships, notably those with Thackeray, George
Henry Lewes, Mrs. Gaskell, and Harriet Martineau, were the only
features that distinguished her literary life from the simple life
she had always led and continued to lead at Haworth. She was ever
busy, if not ever at her desk. Success had come; she was sane in
the midst of it. She wrote slowly and only as she felt the impulse,
and when she knew she had found the proper impression. In 1849
'Shirley' was published. In 1853 appeared 'Villette,' her last
finished work, and the one considered by herself the best.</p>
<p>In 1854 she married her father's curate, Mr. A.B. Nicholls. She
had lost her brother Branwell and her two sisters Emily and Anne.
Sorrow upon sorrow had closed like deepening shadows about her. All
happiness in life for her had apparently ended, when this marriage
brought a brief ray of sunshine. It was a happy union, and seemed
to assure a period of peace and rest for the sorely tried soul.
Only a few short months, however, and fate, as if grudging her even
the bit of happiness, snapped the slender threads of her life and
the whole sad episode of her existence was ended. She died March
31st, 1855, leaving her husband and father to mourn together in the
lonely parsonage. She left a literary fragment--the story entitled
'Emma,' which was published with an introduction by Thackeray.</p>
<p>Such are the main facts of this reserved life of Charlotte
Bront&eacute;. Are they dull and commonplace? Some of them are
indeed inexpressibly sad. Tragedy is beneath all the bitter
chronicle. The sadness of her days can be appreciated by all who
read her books. Through all her stories there is an intense note,
especially in treating the pathos of existence, that is
unmistakably subjective. There is a keen perception of the darker
depths of human nature that could have been revealed to a human
heart only by suffering and sorrow.</p>
<p>She did not allow sadness, however, to crush her spirit. She was
neither morbid nor melancholy, but on the contrary Charlotte was
cheerful and pleasant in disposition and manner. She was a loving
sister and devoted daughter, patient and obedient to a parent who
afterwards made obedience a severe hardship. There were other sides
to her character. She was not always calm. She was not ever tender
and a maker of allowances. But who is such? And she had good reason
to be impatient with the world as she found it.</p>
<p>Her character and disposition are partially reflected in 'Jane
Eyre.' The calm, clear mind, the brave, independent spirit are
there. But a fuller and more accurate picture of her character may
be found in Lucy Snowe, the heroine of 'Villette.' Here we find
especially that note of hopelessness that predominated in
Charlotte's character. Mrs. Gaskell, in her admirable biography of
Charlotte Bront&eacute;, has called attention to this absence of
hope in her nature. Charlotte indeed never allowed herself to look
forward to happy issues. She had no confidence in the future. The
pressure of grief apparently crushed all buoyancy of expectation.
It was in this attitude that when literary success greeted her, she
made little of it, scarcely allowing herself to believe that the
world really set a high value on her work. Throughout all the
excitement that her books produced, she was almost indifferent.
Brought up as she had been to regard literary work as something
beyond the proper limits of her sex, she never could quite rid
herself of the belief that in writing successfully, she had made of
herself not so much a literary figure as a sort of social
curiosity. Nor was that idea wholly foreign to her time.</p>
<p>Personally Charlotte Bront&eacute; was not unattractive. Though
somewhat too slender and pale, and plain of feature, she had a
pleasant expression, and her homelier features were redeemed by a
strong massive forehead, luxuriant glossy hair, and handsome eyes.
Though she had little faith in her powers of inspiring affection,
she attracted people strongly and was well beloved by her friends.
That she could stir romantic sentiment too was attested by the fact
that she received and rejected three proposals of marriage from as
many suitors, before her acceptance of Mr. Nicholls.</p>
<p>Allusion has been made to the work of Charlotte's two sisters,
Emily and Anne. Of the two Emily is by far the more remarkable,
revealing in the single novel we have from her pen a genius as
distinct and individual as that of her more celebrated sister. Had
she lived, it is more than likely that her literary achievements
would have rivaled Charlotte's.</p>
<p>Emily Bront&eacute; has always been something of a puzzle to
biographers. She was eccentric, an odd mixture of bashful reserve
and unexpected spells of frankness, sweet, gentle, and retiring in
disposition, but possessed of great courage. She was two years
younger than Charlotte, but taller. She was slender, though well
formed, and was pale in complexion, with great gray eyes of
remarkable beauty. Emily's literary work is to be found in the
volume of "Poems" of her sisters, her share in that work being
considered superior in imaginative quality and in finish to that of
the others; and in the novel "Wuthering Heights," a weird, horrid
story of astonishing power, written when she was twenty-eight years
of age. Considered purely as an imaginative work, "Wuthering
Heights" is one of the most remarkable stories in English
literature, and is worthy to be ranked with the works of Edgar A.
Poe. Many will say that it might better not have been written, so
utterly repulsive is it, but others will value it as a striking,
though distorted, expression of unmistakable genius. It is a
ghastly and gruesome creation. Not one bright ray redeems it. It
deals with the most evil characters and the most evil phases of
human experience. But it fascinates. Heathcliff, the chief figure
in the book, is one of the greatest villains in fiction,--an
abhorrent creature,--strange, monstrous, Frankensteinesque.</p>
<p>Anne Bront&eacute; is known by her share in the book of "Poems"
and by two novels, "Agnes Gray" and "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,"
both of which are disappointing. The former is based on the
author's experiences as a governess, and is written in the usual
placid style of romances of the time. "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"
found its suggestion in the wretched career of Branwell
Bront&eacute;, and presents a sad and depressing picture of a life
of degradation. The book was not a success, and would no doubt have
sunk long ago into oblivion but for its association with the novels
of Emily and Charlotte.</p>
<p>In studying the work of Charlotte Bront&eacute;, the gifted
older sister of the group, one of the first of the qualities that
impress the reader is her actual creative power. To one of her
imaginative power, the simplest life was sufficient, the smallest
details a fund of material. Mr. Swinburne has called attention to
the fact that Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s characters are individual
creations, not types constructed out of elements gathered from a
wide observation of human nature, and that they are <i>real</i>
creations; that they compel our interest and command our assent
because they are true, inevitably true. Perhaps no better example
of this individualism could be cited than Rochester. The character
is unique. It is not a type, nor has it even a prototype, like so
many of Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s characters. Gossip insisted at
one time that the author intended to picture Thackeray in
Rochester, but this is groundless. Rochester is an original
creation. The character of Jane Eyre, too, while reflecting
something of the author's nature, was distinctly individual; and it
is interesting to note here that with Jane Eyre came a new heroine
into fiction, a woman of calm, clear reason, of firm positive
character, and what was most novel, a plain woman, a homely
heroine.</p>
<p>"Why is it," Charlotte had once said, "that heroines must always
be beautiful?" The hero of romance was always noble and handsome,
the heroine lovely and often insipid, and the scenes set in an
atmosphere of exaggerated idealism. Against this idealism Charlotte
Bront&eacute; revolted. Her effort was always toward realism.</p>
<p>In her realism she reveals a second characteristic scarcely less
marked than her creative powers,--an extraordinary faculty of
observation. She saw the essence, the spirit of things, and the
simplest details of life revealed to her the secrets of human
nature. What she had herself seen and felt--the plain rugged types
of Yorkshire character, the wild scenery of the moorlands--she
reflected with living truth. She got the real fact out of every bit
of material in humanity and nature that her simple life afforded
her. And where her experience could not afford her the necessary
material, she drew upon some mysterious resources in her nature,
which were apparently not less reliable than actual experience. On
being asked once how she could describe so accurately the effects
of opium as she does in 'Villette,' she replied that she knew
nothing of opium, but that she had followed the process she always
adopted in cases of this kind. She had thought intently on the
matter for many a night before falling asleep; till at length,
after some time, she waked in the morning with all clear before
her, just as if she had actually gone through the experience, and
then could describe it word for word as it happened.</p>
<p>Her sensitiveness to impressions of nature was exceedingly keen.
She had what Swinburne calls "an instinct for the tragic use of
landscape." By constant and close observation during her walks she
had established a fellowship with nature in all her phases;
learning her secrets from the voices of the night, from the whisper
of the trees, and from the eerie moaning of the moorland blasts.
She studied the cold sky, and had watched the "coming night-clouds
trailing low like banners drooping."</p>
<p>Other qualities that distinguish her work are purity, depth and
ardor of passion, and spiritual force and fervor. Her genius was
lofty and noble, and an exalted moral quality predominates in her
stories. She was ethical as sincerely as she was emotional.</p>
<p>We have only to consider her technique, in which she is
characteristically original. This originality is noticeable
especially in her use of words. There is a sense of fitness that
often surprises the reader. Words at times in her hands reveal a
new power and significance. In the choice of words Charlotte
Bront&eacute; was scrupulous. She believed that there was just one
word fit to express the idea or shade of meaning she wished to
convey, and she never admitted a substitute, sometimes waiting days
until the right word came. Her expressions are therefore well
fitted and forcible. Though the predominant key is a serious one,
there is nevertheless considerable humor in Charlotte
Bront&eacute;'s work. In 'Shirley' especially we find many happy
scenes, and much wit in repartee. And yet, with all these merits,
one will find at times her style to be lame, stiff, and crude, and
even when strongest, occasionally coarse. Not infrequently she is
melodramatic and sensational. But through it all there is that
pervading sense of reality and it redeems these defects.</p>
<p>Of the unusual, the improbable, the highly colored in Charlotte
Bront&eacute;'s books we shall say little. In criticizing works so
true to life and nature as these, one should not be hasty. We feel
the presence of a seer. Some one once made an objection in
Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s presence to that part of 'Jane Eyre' in
which she hears Rochester's voice calling to her at a great crisis
in her life, he being many miles distant from her at the time.
Charlotte caught her breath and replied in a low voice:--"But it is
a true thing; it really happened." And so it might be said of
Charlotte Bront&eacute;'s work as a whole:--"It is a true thing; it
really happened."</p>

<h3>JANE EYRE'S WEDDING DAY</h3>
<center>From 'Jane Eyre'</center>
<br>
<p>Sophie came at seven to dress me. She was very long indeed in
accomplishing her task; so long that Mr. Rochester--grown, I
suppose, impatient of my delay--sent up to ask why I did not come.
She was just fastening my veil (the plain square of blonde, after
all) to my hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her hands as
soon as I could.</p>
<p>"Stop!" she cried in French, "Look at yourself in the mirror;
you have not taken one peep."</p>
<p>So I turned at the door. I saw a robed and veiled figure, so
unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a
stranger.</p>
<p>"Jane!" called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at
the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester. "Lingerer," he said, "my
brain is on fire with impatience; and you tarry so long!"</p>
<p>He took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over,
pronounced me "fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life,
but the desire of his eyes"; and then, telling me he would give me
but ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he rang the bell. One of his
lately hired servants, a footman, answered it.</p>
<p>"Is John getting the carriage ready?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Is the luggage brought down?"</p>
<p>"They are bringing it down, sir."</p>
<p>"Go you to the church; see if Mr. Wood" (the clergyman) "and the
clerk are there; return and tell me."</p>
<p>The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates;
the footman soon returned.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice."</p>
<p>"And the carriage?"</p>
<p>"The horses are harnessing."</p>
<p>"We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the
moment we return--all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped
on, and the coachman in his seat."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"Jane, are you ready?"</p>
<p>I rose. There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to
wait for or marshal; none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax
stood in the hall as we passed. I would fain have spoken to her,
but my hand was held by a grasp of iron; I was hurried along by a
stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face
was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any
purpose. I wondered what other bridegroom ever looked as he did--so
bent up to a purpose, so grimly resolute; or who, under such
steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.</p>
<p>I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the
drive I gazed neither on sky nor earth; my heart was with my eyes,
and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame. I wanted to
see the invisible thing on which, as we went along, he appeared to
fasten a glance fierce and fell. I wanted to feel the thoughts
whose force he seemed breasting and resisting.</p>
<p>At the churchyard wicket he stopped; he discovered I was quite
out of breath.</p>
<p>"Am I cruel in my love?" he said. "Delay an instant; lean on me,
Jane."</p>
<p>And now I can recall the picture of the gray old house of God
rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling around the steeple, of a
ruddy morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green
grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of
strangers, straying among the low hillocks, and reading the
mementos graven on the few mossy headstones. I noticed them because
as they saw us they passed around to the back of the church; and I
doubted not they were going to enter by the side aisle door and
witness the ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he
was earnestly looking at my face, from which the blood had, I dare
say, momentarily fled; for I felt my forehead dewy and my cheeks
and lips cold. When I rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently
with me up the path to the porch.</p>
<p>We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his
white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him. All was
still; two shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had
been correct; the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now
stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs toward us,
viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a
kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at
Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth his
wife.</p>
<p>Our place was taken at the communion-rails. Hearing a cautious
step behind me, I glanced over my shoulder; one of the strangers--a
gentleman, evidently--was advancing up the chancel. The service
began. The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through:
and then the clergyman came a step farther forward, and bending
slightly toward Mr. Rochester, went on:--</p>
<p>"I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the
dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be
disclosed) that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not
lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for
be ye well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise
than God's word doth allow are not joined together by God, neither
is their matrimony lawful."</p>
<p>He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that
sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred
years. And the clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his
book, and had held his breath but for a moment, was proceeding; his
hand was already stretched toward. Mr. Rochester, as his lips
unclosed to ask, "Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded
wife?"--when a distinct and near voice said, "The marriage cannot
go on: I declare the existence of an impediment."</p>
<p>The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute: the clerk
did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had
rolled under his feet; taking a firmer footing, and not turning his
head or eyes, he said, "Proceed!"</p>
<p>Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep
but low intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said, "I cannot proceed
without some investigation into what has been asserted, and
evidence of its truth or falsehood."</p>
<p>"The ceremony is quite broken off," subjoined the voice behind
us. "I am in a condition to prove my allegation; an insuperable
impediment to this marriage exists."</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not; he stood stubborn and
rigid; making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a
hot and strong grasp he had!--and how like quarried marble was his
pale, firm, massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still,
watchful, and yet wild beneath!</p>
<p>Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. "What is the nature of the
impediment?" he asked. "Perhaps it may be got over--explained
away?"</p>
<p>"Hardly," was the answer: "I have called it insuperable, and I
speak advisedly."</p>
<p>The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,
uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not
loudly.</p>
<p>"It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.
Rochester has a wife now living."</p>
<p>My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never
vibrated to thunder; my blood felt their subtle violence as it had
never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of
swooning. I looked at Mr. Rochester; I made him look at me. His
whole face was colorless rock; his eye was both spark and flint. He
disavowed nothing; he seemed as if he would defy all things.
Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognize in
me a human being, he only twined my waist with his arm and riveted
me to his side.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked of the intruder.</p>
<p>"My name is Briggs, a solicitor of ---- Street, London."</p>
<p>"And you would thrust on me a wife?"</p>
<p>"I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law
recognizes if you do not."</p>
<p>"Favor me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage,
her place of abode."</p>
<p>"Certainly." Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and
read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:--</p>
<p>"I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October, A.D.--" (a
date of fifteen years back), "Edward Fairfax Rochester, of
Thornfield Hall, in the county of ----, and of Ferndean Manor, in
---- shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta
Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his
wife, a Creole, at ---- church, Spanish Town, Jamaica. The record
of the marriage will be found in the register of that church--a
copy of it is now in my possession. Signed, Richard Mason."</p>
<p>"That, if a genuine document, may prove I have been married, but
it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is
still living."</p>
<p>"She was living three months ago," returned the lawyer.</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"I have a witness to the fact whose testimony even you, sir,
will scarcely controvert."</p>
<p>"Produce him--or go to hell!"</p>
<p>"I will produce him first--he is on the spot: Mr. Mason, have
the goodness to step forward."</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his teeth: he
experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him
as I was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run
through his frame.</p>
<p>The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the
background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's
shoulder--yes, it was Mason himself. Mr. Rochester turned and
glared at him. His eye, as I have often said, was a black eye--it
had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his face
flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead received a glow, as from
spreading, ascending heart-fire; and he stirred, lifted his strong
arm; he could have struck Mason--dashed him on the church
floor--shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his body; but Mason
shrank away, and cried faintly, "Good God!" Contempt fell cool on
Mr. Rochester--his passion died as if a blight had shriveled it up;
he only asked, "What have <i>you</i> to say?"</p>
<p>An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips.</p>
<p>"The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again
demand, what have <i>you</i> to say?"</p>
<p>"Sir--sir," interrupted the clergyman, "do not forget you are in
a sacred place." Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, "Are
you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still
living?"</p>
<p>"Courage," urged the lawyer; "speak out."</p>
<p>"She is now living at Thornfield Hall," said Mason, in more
articulate tones. "I saw her there last April. I am her
brother."</p>
<p>"At Thornfield Hall!" ejaculated the clergyman. "Impossible! I
am an old resident in this neighborhood, sir, and I never heard of
a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall."</p>
<p>I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lip, and he muttered,
"No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it, or of her
under that name." He mused; for ten minutes he held counsel with
himself: he formed his resolve, and announced it:--"Enough; all
shall bolt out at once, like a bullet from the barrel. Wood, close
your book and take off your surplice; John Green" (to the clerk)
"leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day." The man
obeyed.</p>
<p>Mr. Rochester continued hardily and recklessly:--"Bigamy is an
ugly word! I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has
out-manoeuvred me, or Providence has checked me--perhaps the last.
I am little better than a devil at this moment; and as my pastor
there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of
God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, my plan is broken up! what this lawyer and his
client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I
was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at
the house up yonder, Wood; but I dare say you have many a time
inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there
under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my
bastard half-sister; some, my cast-off mistress: I now inform you
that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago--Bertha Mason
by name; sister of this resolute personage who is now, with his
quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart
men may bear. Cheer up, Dick! never fear me! I'd almost as soon
strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad
family--idiots and maniacs through three generations! Her mother,
the Creole, was both a mad-woman and a drunkard!--as I found out
after I had wed the daughter; for they were silent on family
secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in
both points. I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest; you can
fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes! Oh! my
experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no
further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come
up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and <i>my wife</i>!
You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing,
and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and
seek sympathy with something at least human. This girl," he
continued, looking at me, "knew no more than you, Wood, of the
disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal, and never
dreamed that she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union
with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and imbruted
partner! Come, all of you, follow."</p>
<p>Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen
came after. At the front door of the hall we found the
carriage.</p>
<p>"Take it back to the coach-house, John," said Mr. Rochester,
coolly: "it will not be wanted to-day."</p>
<p>At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Ad&egrave;le, Sophie, Leah,
advanced to meet and greet us.</p>
<p>"To the right-about--every soul!" cried the master: "away with
your congratulations! Who wants them? Not I! they are fifteen years
too late!"</p>
<p>He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and
still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him; which they did. We
mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to
the third story: the low black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's
master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed
and its pictorial cabinet.</p>
<p>"You know this place, Mason," said our guide; "she bit and
stabbed you here."</p>
<p>He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second
door; this too he opened. In a room without a window there burned a
fire, guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended
from the ceiling by a chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire,
apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at
the further end of the room, a figure ran backward and forward.
What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not at first
sight tell; it groveled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and
growled like some strange wild animal; but it was covered with
clothing; and a quantity of dark grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid
its head and face.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Poole," said Mr. Rochester. "How are you?
and how is your charge to-day?"</p>
<p>"We're tolerable, sir, I thank you," replied Grace, lifting the
boiling mess carefully on to the hob: "rather snappish, but not
'rageous."</p>
<p>A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favorable report: the
clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind feet.</p>
<p>"Ah, sir, she sees you!" exclaimed Grace: "you'd better not
stay."</p>
<p>"Only a few moments, Grace; you must allow me a few
moments."</p>
<p>"Take care then, sir! for God's sake, take care!"</p>
<p>The maniac bellowed; she parted her shaggy locks from her
visage, and gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognized well that
purple face--those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.</p>
<p>"Keep out of the way," said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside;
"she has no knife now, I suppose? and I'm on my guard."</p>
<p>"One never knows what she has, sir, she is so cunning; it is not
in mortal discretion to fathom her craft."</p>
<p>"We had better leave her," whispered Mason.</p>
<p>"Go to the devil!" was his brother-in-law's recommendation.</p>
<p>"'Ware!" cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated
simultaneously. Mr. Rochester flung me behind him; the lunatic
sprang and grappled his throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his
cheek; they struggled. She was a big woman, in stature almost
equaling her husband, and corpulent besides; she showed virile
force in the contest--more than once she almost throttled him,
athletic as he was. He could have settled her with a well-planted
blow; but he would not strike her; he would only wrestle. At last
he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and he pinioned
them behind her; with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to
a chair. The operation was performed amid the fiercest yells and
the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the
spectators; he looked at them with a smile both acrid and
desolate.</p>
<p>"That is <i>my wife</i>," said he. "Such is the sole conjugal
embrace I am ever to know--such are the endearments which are to
solace my leisure hours! And <i>this</i> is what I wished to have"
(laying his hand on my shoulder): "this young girl, who stands so
grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the
gambols of a demon. I wanted her just as a change, after that
fierce rago&ucirc;t. Wood and Briggs, look at the difference.
Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this face with
that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of the
Gospel and man of the law, and remember, with what judgment ye
judge ye shall be judged! Off with you now: I must shut up my
prize."</p>
<p>We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to
give some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me
as he descended the stair.</p>
<p>"You, madam," said he, "are cleared from all blame; your uncle
will be glad to hear it--if indeed he should be still living--when
Mr. Mason returns to Madeira."</p>
<p>"My uncle? What of him? Do you know him?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Mason does; Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of
his house for some years. When your uncle received your letter
intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr.
Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his
health, on his way back to Jamaica happened to be with him. Mr.
Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here
was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester. Mr.
Mason, astonished and distressed, as you may suppose, revealed the
real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a
sick-bed; from which, considering the nature of his
disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he
will ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to
extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he
implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the
false marriage. He referred him to me for assistance, I used all
dispatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless,
must be also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be
dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr.
Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in England
till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre. Have we
anything else to stay for?" he inquired of Mr. Mason.</p>
<p>"No, no; let us be gone," was the anxious reply; and without
waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the
hall door. The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either
of admonition or reproof, with his haughty parishioner: this duty
done, he too departed.</p>
<p>I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room,
to which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,
fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to
weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically
to take off the wedding-dress, and replace if by the stuff gown I
had worn yesterday, as I thought for the last time. I then sat
down: I felt weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my
head dropped on them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard,
seen, moved--followed up and down where I was led or
dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open beyond
disclosure; but <i>now I thought</i>.</p>
<p>The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the
brief scene with the lunatic. The transaction in the church had not
been noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation,
no dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few
words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the
marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester;
answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of
the truth had been uttered by my master: then the living proof had
been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.</p>
<p>I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious
change; nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And
yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday? where was her life? where
were her prospects?</p>
<p>Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a
bride--was a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her
prospects were desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a
white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe
apples; drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hay-field and
corn-field lay a frozen shroud; lanes which last night blushed full
of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the
woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and fragrant as groves
between the tropics, now spread waste, wild, and white as pine
forests in wintry Norway.</p>
<p>My hopes were all dead--struck with a subtle doom, such as in
one night fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt. I looked
on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay
stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive. I looked at my
love, that feeling which was my master's--which he had created: it
shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle;
sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr.
Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh,
never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence
destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been; for he was
not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice to him; I
would not say he had betrayed me: but the attribute of stainless
truth was gone from his idea; and from his presence I must go;
<i>that</i> I perceived well. When--how--whither, I could not yet
discern; but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from
Thornfield. Real affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it
had been only fitful passion; that was balked; he would want me no
more. I should fear even to cross his path now: my view must be
hateful to him. Oh, how blind had been my eyes! how weak my
conduct!</p>

<h3>MADAME BECK</h3>
<center>(From 'Villette')</center>
<br>
<p>"You ayre Engliss?" said a voice at my elbow. I almost bounded,
so unexpected was the sound; so certain had I been of solitude.</p>
<p>No ghost stood beside me, nor anything of spectral aspect;
merely a motherly, dumpy little woman, in a large shawl, a
wrapping-gown, and a clean, trim, nightcap.</p>
<p>I said I was English, and immediately, without further prelude,
we fell to a most remarkable conversation. Madame Beck (for Madame
Beck it was; she had entered by a little door behind me, and being
shod with the shoes of silence, I had heard neither her entrance
nor approach)--Madame Beck had exhausted her command of insular
speech when she said "You ayre Engliss," and she now proceeded to
work away volubly in her own tongue. I answered in mine. She partly
understood me, but as I did not at all understand her--though we
made together an awful clamor (anything like madame's gift of
utterance I had not hitherto heard or imagined)--we achieved little
progress. She rang, ere long, for aid; which arrived in the shape
of a "ma&icirc;tresse," who had been partly educated in an Irish
convent, and was esteemed a perfect adept in the English language.
A bluff little personage this ma&icirc;tresse
was--Labasse-courienne from top to toe: and how she did slaughter
the speech of Albion! However, I told her a plain tale, which she
translated. I told her how I had left my own country, intent on
extending my knowledge and gaining my bread; how I was ready to
turn my hand to any useful thing, provided it was not wrong or
degrading: how I would be a child's nurse or a lady's-maid, and
would not refuse even housework adapted to my strength. Madame
heard this; and questioning her countenance, I almost thought the
tale won her ear.</p>
<p>"Il n'y a que les Anglaises pour ces sortes d'entreprises," said
she: "sont-elles done intr&eacute;pides, ces femmes-l&agrave;!"</p>
<p>She asked my name, my age; she sat and looked at me--not
pityingly, not with interest: never a gleam of sympathy or a shade
of compassion crossed her countenance during the interview. I felt
she was not one to be led an inch by her feelings: grave and
considerate, she gazed, consulting her judgment and studying my
narrative....</p>
<p>In the dead of night I suddenly awoke. All was hushed, but a
white figure stood in the room--Madame in her night-dress. Moving
without perceptible sound, she visited the three children in the
three beds; she approached me; I feigned sleep, and she studied me
long. A small pantomime ensued, curious enough. I dare say she sat
a quarter of an hour on the edge of my bed, gazing at my face. She
then drew nearer, bent close over me; slightly raised my cap, and
turned back the border so as to expose my hair; she looked at my
hand lying on the bed-clothes. This done, she turned to the chair
where my clothes lay; it was at the foot of the bed. Hearing her
touch and lift them, I opened my eyes with precaution, for I own I
felt curious to see how far her taste for research would lead her.
It led her a good way: every article did she inspect. I divined her
motive for this proceeding; viz., the wish to form from the
garments a judgment respecting the wearer, her station, means,
neatness, etc. The end was not bad, but the means were hardly fair
or justifiable. In my dress was a pocket; she fairly turned it
inside out; she counted the money in my purse; she opened a little
memorandum-book, coolly perused its contents, and took from between
the leaves a small plaited lock of Miss Marchmont's gray hair. To a
bunch of three keys, being those of my trunk, desk, and work-box,
she accorded special attention: with these, indeed, she withdrew a
moment to her own room. I softly rose in my bed and followed her
with my eye: these keys, reader, were not brought back till they
had left on the toilet of the adjoining room the impress of their
wards in wax. All being thus done decently and in order, my
property was returned to its place, my clothes were carefully
refolded. Of what nature were the conclusions deduced from this
scrutiny? Were they favorable or otherwise? Vain question. Madame's
face of stone (for of stone in its present night-aspect it looked:
it had been human, and as I said before, motherly, in the salon)
betrayed no response.</p>
<p>Her duty done--I felt that in her eyes this business was a
duty--she rose, noiseless as a shadow: she moved toward her own
chamber; at the door she turned, fixing her eyes on the heroine of
the bottle, who still slept and loudly snored. Mrs. Svini (I
presume this was Mrs. Svini, Anglic&eacute; or Hibernic&eacute;
Sweeny)--Mrs. Sweeny's doom was in Madame Beck's eye--an immutable
purpose that eye spoke: madame's visitations for shortcomings might
be slow, but they were sure. All this was very un-English: truly I
was in a foreign land....</p>
<p>When attired, Madame Beck appeared a personage of a figure
rather short and stout, yet still graceful in its own peculiar way:
that is, with the grace resulting from proportion of parts. Her
complexion was fresh and sanguine, not too rubicund; her eye, blue
and serene; her dark silk dress fitted her as a French sempstress
alone can make a dress fit; she looked well, though a little
bourgeoise, as bourgeoise indeed she was. I know not what of
harmony pervaded her whole person; and yet her face offered
contrast too: its features were by no means such as are usually
seen in conjunction with a complexion of such blended freshness and
repose: their outline was stern; her forehead was high but narrow;
it expressed capacity and some benevolence, but no expanse; nor did
her peaceful yet watchful eye ever know the fire which is kindled
in the heart or the softness which flows thence. Her mouth was
hard: it could be a little grim; her lips were thin. For
sensibility and genius, with all their tenderness and temerity, I
felt somehow that madame would be the right sort of Minos in
petticoats.</p>
<p>In the long run, I found that she was something else in
petticoats too. Her name was Modeste Maria Beck, n&eacute;e Kint:
it ought to have been Ignacia. She was a charitable woman, and did
a great deal of good. There never was a mistress whose rule was
milder. I was told that she never once remonstrated with the
intolerable Mrs. Sweeny [the heroine's predecessor], despite her
tipsiness, disorder, and general neglect; yet Mrs. Sweeny had to
go, the moment her departure became convenient. I was told too that
neither masters nor teachers were found fault with in that
establishment: yet both masters and teachers were often changed;
they vanished and others filled their places, none could well
explain how.</p>
<p>The establishment was both a pensionnat and an externat: the
externes or day-pupils exceeded one hundred in number; the boarders
were about a score. Madame must have possessed high administrative
powers: she ruled all these, together with four teachers, eight
masters, six servants, and three children, managing at the same
time to perfection the pupil's parents and friends; and that
without apparent effort, without bustle, fatigue, fever, or any
symptom of undue excitement; occupied she always was--busy, rarely.
It is true that madame had her own system for managing and
regulating this mass of machinery; and a very pretty system it was:
the reader has seen a specimen of it in that small affair of
turning my pocket inside out and reading my private memoranda.
<i>Surveillance, espionnage</i>, these were her watchwords.</p>
<p>Still, madame knew what honesty was, and liked it--that is, when
it did not obtrude its clumsy scruples in the way of her will and
interest. She had a respect for "Angleterre"; and as to "les
Anglaises," she would have the women of no other country about her
own children, if she could help it.</p>
<p>Often in the evening, after she had been plotting and
counter-plotting, spying and receiving the reports of spies all
day, she would come up to my room, a trace of real weariness on her
brow, and she would sit down and listen while the children said
their little prayers to me in English: the Lord's Prayer and the
hymn beginning "Gentle Jesus," these little Catholics were
permitted to repeat at my knee; and when I had put them to bed, she
would talk to me (I soon gained enough French to be able to
understand and even answer her) about England and Englishwomen, and
the reason for what she was pleased to term their superior
intelligence, and, more real and reliable probity. Very good sense
she often showed; very sound opinions she often broached: she
seemed to know that keeping girls in distrustful restraint, in
blind ignorance, and under a surveillance that left them no moment
and no corner for retirement, was not the best way to make them
grow up honest and modest women; but she averred that ruinous
consequences would ensue if any other method were tried with
Continental children--they were so accustomed to restraint that
relaxation, however guarded, would be misunderstood and fatally
presumed on: she was sick, she would declare, of the means she had
to use, but use them she must; and after discoursing, often with
dignity and delicacy, to me, she would move away on her "souliers
de silence," and glide ghost-like through the house, watching and
spying everywhere, peering through every key-hole, listening behind
every door.</p>
<p>After all, madame's system was not bad--let me do her justice.
Nothing could be better than all her arrangements for the physical
well-being of her scholars. No minds were overtasked; the lessons
were well distributed and made incomparably easy to the learner;
there was a liberty of amusement and a provision for exercise which
kept the girls healthy; the food was abundant and good: neither
pale nor puny faces were anywhere to be seen in the Rue Fossette.
She never grudged a holiday; she allowed plenty of time for
sleeping, dressing, washing, eating: her method in all these
matters was easy, liberal, salutary, and rational; many an austere
English schoolmistress would do vastly well to imitate it--and I
believe many would be glad to do so, if exacting English parents
would let them.</p>
<p>As Madame Beck ruled by espionage, she of course had her staff
of spies; she perfectly knew the quality of the tools she used, and
while she would not scruple to handle the dirtiest for a dirty
occasion--flinging this sort from her like refuse rind? after the
orange has been duly squeezed--I have known her fastidious in
seeking pure metal for clean uses; and when once a bloodless and
rustless instrument was found, she was careful of the prize,
keeping it in silk and cotton-wool. Yet woe be to the man or woman
who relied on her one inch beyond the point where it was her
interest to be trustworthy; interest was the master-key of madame's
nature--the mainspring of her motives--the alpha and omega of her
life. I have seen her <i>feelings</i> appealed to, and I have
smiled in half-pity, half-scorn at the appellants. None ever gained
her ear through that channel, or swayed her purpose by that means.
On the contrary, to attempt to touch her heart was the surest way
to rouse her antipathy, and to make of her a secret foe. It proved
to her that she had no heart to be touched: it reminded her where
she was impotent and dead. Never was the distinction between
charity and mercy better exemplified than in her. While devoid of
sympathy, she had a sufficiency of rational benevolence: she would
give in the readiest manner to people she had never seen--rather,
however, to classes than to individuals. "Pour les pauvres" she
opened her purse freely--against the <i>poor man</i>, as a rule,
she kept it closed. In philanthropic schemes, for the benefit of
society at large, she took a cheerful part; no private sorrow
touched her: no force or mass of suffering concentrated in one
heart had power to pierce hers. Not the agony of Gethsemane, not
the death on Calvary, could have wrung from her eyes one tear.</p>
<p>I say again, madame was a very great and a very capable woman.
That school offered for her powers too limited a sphere: she ought
to have swayed a nation; she should have been the leader of a
turbulent legislative assembly. Nobody could have browbeaten her,
none irritated her nerves, exhausted her patience, or overreached
her astuteness. In her own single person, she could have comprised
the duties of a first minister and a superintendent of police.
Wise, firm, faithless, secret, crafty, passionless; watchful and
inscrutable; acute and insensate--withal perfectly decorous--what
more could be desired?</p>

<h3>A YORKSHIRE LANDSCAPE</h3>
<center>From 'Shirley'</center>
<br>
<p>"Miss Keeldar, just stand still now, and look down at Nunneley
dale and wood."</p>
<p>They both halted on the green brow of the Common. They looked
down on the deep valley robed in May raiment; on varied meads, some
pearled with daisies and some golden with kingcups: to-day all this
young verdure smiled clear in sunlight; transparent emerald and
amber gleams played over it. On Nunnwood--the sole remnant of
antique British forest in a region whose lowlands were once all
sylvan chase, as its highlands were breast-deep heather--slept the
shadow of a cloud; the distant hills were dappled, the horizon was
shaded and tinted like mother-of-pearl; silvery blues, soft
purples, evanescent greens and rose-shades, all melting into
fleeces of white cloud, pure as azury snow, allured the eye with a
remote glimpse of heaven's foundations. The air blowing on the brow
was fresh and sweet and bracing.</p>
<p>"Our England is a bonnie island," said Shirley, "and Yorkshire
is one of her bonniest nooks."</p>
<p>"You are a Yorkshire girl too?"</p>
<p>"I am--Yorkshire in blood and birth. Five generations of my race
sleep under the aisles of Briarfield Church: I drew my first breath
in the old black hall behind us."</p>
<p>Hereupon Caroline presented her hand, which was accordingly
taken and shaken. "We are compatriots," said she.</p>
<p>"Yes," agreed Shirley, with a grave nod.</p>
<p>"And that," asked Miss Keeldar, pointing to the forest--"that is
Nunnwood?"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"Were you ever there?"</p>
<p>"Many a time."</p>
<p>"In the heart of it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What is it like?"</p>
<p>"It is like an encampment of forest sons of Anak. The trees are
huge and old. When you stand at their roots, the summits seem in
another region: the trunks remain still and firm as pillars, while
the boughs sway to every breeze. In the deepest calm their leaves
are never quite hushed, and in a high wind a flood rushes--a sea
thunders above you."</p>
<p>"Was it not one of Robin Hood's haunts?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and there are mementos of him still existing. To penetrate
into Nunnwood, Miss Keeldar, is to go far back into the dim days of
old. Can you see a break in the forest, about the centre?"</p>
<p>"Yes, distinctly."</p>
<p>"That break is a dell--a deep hollow cup, lined with turf as
green and short as the sod of this Common: the very oldest of the
trees, gnarled mighty oaks, crowd about the brink of this dell; in
the bottom lie the ruins of a nunnery.</p>
<p>"We will go--you and I alone, Caroline--to that wood, early some
fine summer morning, and spend a long day there. We can take
pencils and sketch-books, and any interesting reading-book we like;
and of course we shall take something to eat. I have two little
baskets, in which Mrs. Gill, my house-keeper, might pack our
provisions, and we could each carry our own. It would not tire you
too much to walk so far?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no; especially if we rested the whole day in the wood; and
I know all the pleasantest spots. I know where we could get nuts in
nutting time; I know where wild strawberries abound; I know certain
lonely, quite untrodden glades, carpeted with strange mosses, some
yellow as if gilded, some a sober gray, some gem-green. I know
groups of trees that ravish the eye with their perfect,
picture-like effects: rude oak, delicate birch, glossy beech,
clustered in contrast; and ash-trees, stately as Saul, standing
isolated; and superannuated wood-giants clad in bright shrouds of
ivy."</p>

<h3>THE END OF HEATHCLIFF</h3>
<center>From Emily Bront&eacute;'s 'Wuthering Heights'</center>
<br>
<p>For some days after that evening Mr. Heathcliff shunned meeting
us at meals; yet he would not consent formally to exclude Hareton
and Cathy. He had an aversion to yielding so completely to his
feelings, choosing rather to absent himself; and eating once in
twenty-four hours seemed sufficient sustenance for him.</p>
<p>One night, after the family were in bed, I heard him go
down-stairs and out at the front door; I did not hear him re-enter,
and in the morning I found he was still away. We were in April
then, the weather was sweet and warm, the grass as green as showers
and sun could make it, and the two dwarf apple-trees near the
southern wall in full bloom.</p>
<p>After breakfast, Catherine insisted on my bringing a chair and
sitting with my work under the fir-trees at the end of the house;
and she beguiled Hareton, who had recovered from his accident, to
dig and arrange her little garden, which was shifted to that corner
by the influence of Joseph's complaints.</p>
<p>I was comfortably reveling in the spring fragrance around, and
the beautiful soft blue overhead, when my young lady, who had run
down near the gate to procure some primrose roots for a border,
returned only half laden, and informed us that Mr. Heathcliff was
coming in.</p>
<p>"And he spoke to me," she added with a perplexed look.</p>
<p>"What did he say?" asked Hareton.</p>
<p>"He told me to begone as fast as I could," she answered. "But he
looked so different from his usual look that I stopped a moment to
stare at him."</p>
<p>"How?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"Why, almost bright and cheerful--no, almost nothing--<i>very
much</i> excited, and wild, and glad!" she replied.</p>
<p>"Night-walking amuses him, then," I remarked, affecting a
careless manner; in reality as surprised as she was, and anxious to
ascertain the truth of her statement--for to see the master looking
glad would not be an every-day spectacle; I framed an excuse to go
in.</p>
<p>Heathcliff stood at the open door--he was pale, and he trembled;
yet certainly he had a strange joyful glitter in his eyes, that
altered the aspect of his whole face.</p>
<p>"Will you have some breakfast?" I said. "You must be hungry,
rambling about all night!"</p>
<p>I wanted to discover where he had been; but I did not like to
ask directly.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not hungry," he answered, averting his head, and
speaking rather contemptuously, as if he guessed I was trying to
divine the occasion of his good humor.</p>
<p>I felt perplexed--I didn't know whether it were not a proper
opportunity to offer a bit of admonition.</p>
<p>"I don't think it right to wander out of doors," I observed,
"instead of being in bed; it is not wise, at any rate, this moist
season. I daresay you'll catch a bad cold, or a fever--you have
something the matter with you now!"</p>
<p>"Nothing but what I can bear," he replied, "and with the
greatest pleasure, provided you'll leave me alone--get in, and
don't annoy me."</p>
<p>I obeyed; and in passing, I saw he breathed as fast as a
cat.</p>
<p>"Yes!" I reflected to myself, "we shall have a fit of illness. I
cannot conceive what he has been doing!"</p>
<p>That noon he sat down to dinner with us, and received a
heaped-up plate from my hands, as if he intended to make amends for
previous fasting.</p>
<p>"I've neither cold nor fever, Nelly," he remarked, in allusion
to my morning speech. "And I'm ready to do justice to the food you
give me."</p>
<p>He took his knife and fork, and was going to commence eating,
when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct. He laid
them on the table, looked eagerly toward the window, then rose and
went out. We saw him walking to and fro in the garden, while we
concluded our meal; and Earnshaw said he'd go and ask why he would
not dine; he thought we had grieved him some way.</p>
<p>"Well, is he coming?" cried Catherine, when he returned.</p>
<p>"Nay," he answered; "but he's not angry: he seemed rare and
pleased indeed; only I made him impatient by speaking to him twice:
and then he bid me be off to you; he wondered how I could want the
company of anybody else."</p>
<p>I set his plate to keep warm on the fender; and after an hour or
two he re-entered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer:
the same unnatural--it was unnatural!--appearance of joy under his
black brows; the same bloodless hue; and his teeth visible now and
then in a kind of smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers
with chill or weakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a
strong thrilling, rather than trembling.</p>
<p>"I will ask what is the matter," I thought, "or who should?" And
I exclaimed, "Have you heard any good news, Mr. Heathcliff? You
look uncommonly animated."</p>
<p>"Where should good news come from to me?" he said. "I'm animated
with hunger; and seemingly I must not eat."</p>
<p>"Your dinner is here," I returned: "why won't you get it?"</p>
<p>"I don't want it now," he muttered hastily. "I'll wait till
supper. And, Nelly, once for all, let me beg you to warn Hareton
and the other away from me. I wish to be troubled by nobody--I wish
to have this place to myself."</p>
<p>"Is there some new reason for this banishment?" I inquired.
"Tell me why you are so queer, Mr. Heathcliff. Where were you last
night? I'm not putting the question through idle curiosity,
but--"</p>
<p>"You are putting the question through very idle curiosity," he
interrupted, with a laugh. "Yet I'll answer it. Last night I was on
the threshold of hell. To-day I am within sight of my heaven--I
have my eyes on it--hardly three feet to sever me. And now you'd
better go. You'll neither see nor hear anything to frighten you if
you refrain from prying."</p>
<p>Having swept the hearth and wiped the table, I departed more
perplexed than ever. He did not quit the house again that
afternoon, and no one intruded on his solitude till at eight
o'clock I deemed it proper, though unsummoned, to carry a candle
and his supper to him.</p>
<p>He was leaning against the ledge of an open lattice, but not
looking out; his face was turned to the interior gloom. The fire
had smoldered to ashes; the room was filled with the damp, mild air
of the cloudy evening; and so still, that not only the murmur of
the beck down Gimmerton was distinguishable, but its ripples, and
its gurgling over the pebbles, or through the large stones which it
could not cover.</p>
<p>I uttered an ejaculation of discontent at seeing the dismal
grate, and commenced shutting the casements, one after another,
till I came to his.</p>
<p>"Must I close this?" I asked, in order to rouse him, for he
would not stir.</p>
<p>The light flashed on his features as I spoke. O Mr. Lockwood, I
cannot express what a terrible start I got by the momentary view!
Those deep black eyes! That smile and ghastly paleness! It appeared
to me not Mr. Heathcliff, but a goblin; and in my terror I let the
candle bend toward the wall, and it left me in darkness.</p>
<p>"Yes, close it," he replied in his familiar voice. "There, that
is pure awkwardness! Why did you hold the candle horizontally? Be
quick, and bring another."</p>
<p>I hurried out in a foolish state of dread, and said to Joseph,
"The master wishes you to take him a light and rekindle the fire."
For I dare not go in myself again just then.</p>
<p>Joseph rattled some fire into the shovel and went; but he
brought it back immediately, with the supper tray in his other
hand, explaining that Mr. Heathcliff was going to bed, and he
wanted nothing to eat till morning.</p>
<p>We heard him mount the stairs directly. He did not proceed to
his ordinary chamber, but turned into that with the paneled bed;
its window, as I mentioned before, is wide enough for anybody to
get through, and it struck me that he plotted another midnight
excursion, which he had rather we had no suspicion of.</p>
<p>"Is he a ghoul, or a vampire?" I mused. I had read of such
hideous incarnate demons. And then I set myself to reflect how I
had tended him in infancy, and watched him grow to youth, and
followed him almost through his whole course, and what nonsense it
was to yield to that sense of horror.</p>
<p>"But where did he come from, the little dark thing, harbored by
a good man to his bane?" muttered Superstition, as I dozed into
unconsciousness. And I began, half dreaming, to weary myself with
imagining some fit parentage for him: and repeating my waking
meditations I tracked his existence over again, with grim
variations; at last picturing his death and funeral; of which all I
can remember is being exceedingly vexed at having the task of
dictating an inscription for his monument, and consulting the
sexton about it; and as he had no surname, and we could not tell
his age, we were obliged to content ourselves with the single word
"Heathcliff." That came true--we were. If you enter the kirkyard,
you'll read on his headstone only that, and the date of his death.
Dawn restored me to common-sense. I rose, and went into the garden,
as soon as I could see, to ascertain if there were any foot-marks
under his window. There were none.</p>
<p>"He has staid at home," I thought, "and he'll be all right
to-day!"</p>
<p>I prepared breakfast for the household, as was my usual custom,
but told Hareton and Catherine to get theirs ere the master came
down, for he lay late. They preferred taking it out of doors, under
the trees, and I set a little table to accommodate them.</p>
<p>On my re-entrance I found Mr. Heathcliff below. He and Joseph
were conversing about some farming business; he gave clear, minute
directions concerning the matter discussed, but he spoke rapidly,
and turned his head continually aside, and had the same excited
expression, even more exaggerated.</p>
<p>When Joseph quitted the room, he took his seat in the place he
generally chose, and I put a basin of coffee before him. He drew it
nearer, and then rested his arms on the table, and looked at the
opposite wall, as I supposed surveying one particular portion, up
and down, with glittering, restless eyes, and with such eager
interest that he stopped breathing during half a minute
together.</p>
<p>"Come now," I exclaimed, pushing some bread against his hand,
"eat and drink that while it is hot. It has been waiting near an
hour."</p>
<p>He didn't notice me, and yet he smiled. I'd rather have seen him
gnash his teeth than smile so.</p>
<p>"Mr. Heathcliff! master!" I cried. "Don't, for God's sake, stare
as if you saw an unearthly vision."</p>
<p>"Don't, for God's sake, shout so loud," he replied. "Turn round
and tell me, are we by ourselves?"</p>
<p>"Of course," was my answer, "of course we are!"</p>
<p>Still I involuntarily obeyed him, as if I were not quite sure.
With a sweep of his hand he cleared a vacant space in front among
the breakfast things, and leaned forward to gaze more at his
ease.</p>
<p>Now I perceived he was not looking at the wall; for when I
regarded him alone, it seemed exactly that he gazed at something
within two yards' distance. And, whatever it was, it communicated
apparently both pleasure and pain in exquisite extremes; at least
the anguished yet raptured expression of his countenance suggested
that idea.</p>
<p>The fancied object was not fixed either; his eyes pursued it
with unwearied vigilance, and even in speaking to me, were never
weaned away.</p>
<p>I vainly reminded him of his protracted abstinence from food. If
he stirred to touch anything in compliance with my entreaties--if
he stretched his hand out to get a piece of bread--his fingers
clenched before they reached it, and remained on the table,
forgetful of their aim.</p>
<p>I sat, a model of patience, trying to attract his absorbed
attention from its engrossing speculation till he grew irritable
and got up, asking why I would not allow him to have his own time
in taking his meals? and saying that on the next occasion I needn't
wait--I might set the things down and go. Having uttered these
words, he left the house, slowly sauntered down the garden path,
and disappeared through the gate.</p>
<p>The hours crept anxiously by: another evening came. I did not
retire to rest till late, and when I did I could not sleep. He
returned after midnight, and instead of going to bed, shut himself
into the room beneath. I listened and tossed about, and finally
dressed and descended. It was too irksome to lie up there,
harassing my brain with a hundred idle misgivings.</p>
<p>I distinguished Mr. Heathcliff's step, restlessly measuring the
floor; and he frequently broke the silence by a deep inspiration,
resembling a groan. He muttered detached words also; the only one I
could catch was the name of Catherine, coupled with some wild term
of endearment or suffering, and spoken as one would speak to a
person present--low and earnest, and wrung from the depth of his
soul.</p>
<p>I had not courage to walk straight into the apartment; but I
desired to divert him from his revery, and therefore fell foul of
the kitchen fire; stirred it and began to scrape the cinders. It
drew him forth sooner than I expected. He opened the door
immediately, and said:--</p>
<p>"Nelly, come here--is it morning? Come in with your light."</p>
<p>"It is striking four," I answered; "you want a candle to take
upstairs--you might have lighted one at this fire."</p>
<p>"No, I don't wish to go upstairs," he said. "Come in, and kindle
<i>me</i> a fire, and do anything there is to do about the
room."</p>
<p>"I must blow the coals red first, before I can carry any," I
replied, getting a chair and the bellows.</p>
<p>He roamed to and fro, meantime, in a state approaching
distraction, his heavy sighs succeeding each other so thick as to
leave no space for common breathing between.</p>
<p>"When day breaks, I'll send for Green," he said; "I wish to make
some legal inquiries of him, while I can bestow a thought on those
matters, and while I can act calmly. I have not written my will
yet, and how to leave my property I cannot determine! I wish I
could annihilate it from the face of the earth."</p>
<p>"I would not talk so, Mr. Heathcliff," I interposed. "Let your
will be a while--you'll be spared to repent of your many injustices
yet! I never expected that your nerves would be disordered--they
are, at present, marvelously so, however; and almost entirely
through your own fault. The way you've passed these last three days
might knock up a Titan. Do take some food and some repose. You need
only look at yourself in a glass to see how you require both. Your
cheeks are hollow and your eyes bloodshot, like a person starving
with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep."</p>
<p>"It is not my fault that I cannot eat or rest," he replied. "I
assure you it is through no settled designs. I'll do both as soon
as I possibly can. But you might as well bid a man struggling in
the water rest within arm's-length of the shore! I must reach it
first, and then I'll rest. Well, never mind Mr. Green; as to
repenting of my injustices, I've done no injustice, and I repent of
nothing. I'm too happy, and yet I'm not happy enough. My soul's
bliss kills my body, but does not satisfy itself."</p>
<p>"Happy, master?" I cried. "Strange happiness! If you would hear
me without being angry, I might offer some advice that would make
you happier."</p>
<p>"What is that?" he asked. "Give it."</p>
<p>"You are aware, Mr. Heathcliff," I said, "that from the time you
were thirteen years old you have lived a selfish, unchristian life:
and probably hardly had a Bible in your hands during all that
period. You must have forgotten the contents of the book, and you
may not have space to search it now. Could it be hurtful to send
for some one--some minister of any denomination, it does not matter
which--to explain it, and show you how very far you have erred from
its precepts, and how unfit you will be for its heaven, unless a
change takes place before you die?"</p>
<p>"I'm rather obliged than angry, Nelly," he said, "for you remind
me of the manner that I desire to be buried in. It is to be carried
to the churchyard in the evening. You and Hareton may, if you
please, accompany me--and mind, particularly, to notice that the
sexton obeys my directions concerning the two coffins! No minister
need come; nor need anything be said over me. I tell you, I have
nearly attained <i>my</i> heaven; and that of others is altogether
unvalued and uncoveted by me!"</p>
<p>"And supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died
by that means, and they refused to bury you in the precincts of the
kirk?" I said, shocked at his godless indifference. "How would you
like it?"</p>
<p>"They won't do that," he replied; "if they did, you must have me
removed secretly; and if you neglect it, you shall prove
practically that the dead are not annihilated!"</p>
<p>As soon as he heard the other members of the family stirring, he
retired to his den, and I breathed freer. But in the afternoon,
while Joseph and Hareton were at their work, he came into the
kitchen again, and with a wild look bid me come and sit in the
house--he wanted somebody with him.</p>
<p>I declined, telling him plainly that his strange talk and manner
frightened me, and I had neither the nerve nor the will to be his
companion alone.</p>
<p>"I believe you think me a fiend!" he said, with his dismal
laugh; "something too horrible to live under a decent roof!"</p>
<p>Then turning to Catherine, who was there, and who drew behind me
at his approach, he added, half sneeringly:--</p>
<p>"Will <i>you</i> come, chuck? I'll not hurt you. No! to you I've
made myself worse than the devil. Well, there is <i>one</i> who
won't shrink from my company! By God! she's relentless. Oh, damn
it! It's unutterably too much for flesh and blood to bear, even
mine."</p>
<p>He solicited the society of no one more. At dusk he went into
his chamber. Through the whole night, and far into the morning, we
heard him groaning and murmuring to himself. Hareton was anxious to
enter, but I bid him fetch Mr. Kenneth, and he should go in and see
him.</p>
<p>When he came, and I requested admittance and tried to open the
door, I found it locked; and Heathcliff bid us be damned. He was
better, and would be left alone; so the doctor went away.</p>
<p>The following evening was very wet; indeed, it poured down till
day-dawn; and as I took my morning walk round the house, I observed
the master's window swinging open, and the rain driving straight
in.</p>
<p>"He cannot be in bed," I thought: "those showers would drench
him through! He must be either up or out. But I'll make no more
ado; I'll go boldly, and look!"</p>
<p>Having succeeded in obtaining entrance with another key, I ran
to unclose the panels, for the chamber was vacant--quickly pushing
them aside, I peeped in. Mr. Heathcliff was there--laid on his
back. His eyes met mine, so keen and fierce that I started; and
then he seemed to smile.</p>
<p>I could not think him dead--but his face and throat were washed
with rain; the bed-clothes dripped, and he was perfectly still. The
lattice, flapping to and fro, had grazed one hand that rested on
the sill--no blood trickled from the broken skin, and when I put my
fingers to it I could doubt no more--he was dead and stark!</p>
<p>I hasped the window; I combed his long, black hair from his
forehead; I tried to close his eyes--to extinguish, if possible,
that frightful, lifelike exultation, before any one else beheld it.
They would not shut--they seemed to sneer at my attempts, and his
parted lips and sharp white teeth sneered too! Taken with another
fit of cowardice, I cried out for Joseph. Joseph shuffled up and
made a noise, but resolutely refused to meddle with him. "Th'
divil's harried off his soul," he cried, "and he muh hev his
carcass intuh t' bargain, for ow't aw care! Ech! what a wicked un
he looks, grinning at death!" and the old sinner grinned in
mockery.</p>
<p>I thought he intended to cut a caper round the bed; but suddenly
composing himself, he fell on his knees and raised his hands, and
returned thanks that the lawful master and the ancient stock were
restored to their rights.</p>
<p>I felt stunned by the awful event; and my memory unavoidably
recurred to former times with a sort of oppressive sadness. But
poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one that really
suffered much. He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter
earnest. He pressed its hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face
that every one else shrank from contemplating; and bemoaned him
with that strong grief which springs naturally from a generous
heart, though it be tough as tempered steel.</p>
<p>Kenneth was perplexed to pronounce of what disorder the master
died. I concealed the fact of his having swallowed nothing for four
days, fearing it might lead to trouble; and then, I am persuaded,
he did not abstain on purpose: it was the consequence of his
strange illness, not the cause.</p>
<p>We buried him, to the scandal of the whole neighborhood, as he
had wished. Earnshaw and I, the sexton, and six men to carry the
coffin, comprehended the whole attendance.</p>
<p>The six men departed when they had let it down into the grave:
we stayed to see it covered. Hareton, with a streaming face, dug
green sods and laid them over the brown mold himself. At present it
is as smooth and verdant as its companion mounds--and I hope its
tenant sleeps as soundly. But the country folks, if you asked them,
would swear on their Bibles that he <i>walks</i>. There are those
who speak to having met him near the church, and on the moor, and
even within this house. Idle tales, you'll say, and so say I. Yet
that old man by the kitchen fire affirms he has seen "two on 'em"
looking out of his chamber window on every rainy night since his
death--and an odd thing happened to me about a month ago.</p>
<p>I was going to the grange one evening--a dark evening
threatening thunder--and, just at the turn of the Heights, I
encountered a little boy with a sheep and two lambs before him. He
was crying terribly, and I supposed the lambs were skittish and
would not be guided.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, my little man?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They's Heathcliff and a woman yonder, under t' nab," he
blubbered, "un' aw darnut pass 'em."</p>
<p>I saw nothing, but neither the sheep nor he would go on, so I
bid him take the road lower down. He probably raised the phantoms
from thinking, as he traversed the moors alone, on the nonsense he
had heard his parents and companions repeat; yet still I don't like
being out in the dark now, and I don't like being left by myself in
this grim house. I cannot help it; I shall be glad when they leave
it and shift to the Grange!</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>"They are going to the Grange, then?" I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Mrs. Dean, "as soon as they are married; and
that will be on New Year's day."</p>
<p>"And who will live here then?"</p>
<p>"Why, Joseph will take care of the house, and perhaps a lad to
keep him company. They will live in the kitchen, and the rest will
be shut up."</p>
<p>"For the use of such ghosts as choose to inhabit it," I
observed.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Lockwood," said Nelly, shaking her head. "I believe the
dead are at peace, but it is not right to speak of them with
levity."</p>
<p>At that moment the garden gate swung to; the ramblers were
returning.</p>
<p>"<i>They</i> are afraid of nothing," I grumbled, watching their
approach through the window. "Together they would brave Satan and
all his legions."</p>
<p>As they stepped upon the door-stones, and halted to take a last
look at the moon, or more correctly at each other, by her light, I
felt irresistibly impelled to escape them again; and pressing a
remembrance into the hands of Mrs. Dean, and disregarding her
expostulations at my rudeness, I vanished through the kitchen, as
they opened the house-door; and so should have confirmed Joseph in
his opinion of his fellow-servant's gay indiscretions, had he not
fortunately recognized me for a respectable character by the sweet
ring of a sovereign at his feet.</p>
<p>My walk home was lengthened by a diversion in the direction of
the kirk. When beneath its walls, I perceived decay had made
progress even in seven months--many a window showed black gaps
deprived of glass; and slates jutted off, here and there, beyond
the right line of the roof, to be gradually worked off in coming
autumn storms.</p>
<p>I sought, and soon discovered, the three headstones on the slope
next the moor--the middle one, gray, and half buried in the
heath--Edgar Linton's only harmonized by the turf and moss creeping
up its foot--Heathcliff's still bare.</p>
<p>I lingered round them, under that benign sky; watched the moths
fluttering among the heath and harebells; listened to the soft wind
breathing through the grass; and wondered how any one could ever
imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.</p>

<h2>PHILLIPS BROOKS</h2>
<h3>(1835-1893)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-p.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>hillips Brooks was born in Boston, Massachusetts, December 13th,
1835, and died there January 23d, 1893. He inherited the best
traditions of New England history, being on the paternal side the
direct descendant of John Cotton, and his mother's name, Phillips,
standing for high learning and distinction in the Congregational
church. Born at a time when the orthodox faith was fighting its
bitterest battle with Unitarianism, his parents accepted the dogmas
of the new theology, and had him baptized by a Unitarian clergyman.
But while refusing certain dogmas of the orthodox church, they were
the more thrown back for spiritual support upon the internal
evidences of evangelical Christianity. "Holding still," says the
Rev. Arthur Brooks, "in a greater or less degree, and with more or
less precision, to the old statements, they counted the great fact
that these statements enshrined more precious truth than any
other." Transition to the Episcopal church was easy; the mother
became an Episcopalian, and Phillips Brooks received all his early
training in that communion. But heredity had its influence, and in
after-life the great Bishop said that the Episcopal church could
reap the fruits of the long and bitter controversy which divided
the New England church, only as it discerned the spiritual worth of
Puritanism, and the value of its contributions to the history of
religious thought and character.</p>
<p>Such were the early surroundings of the man, and the subsequent
influences of his life tended to foster this liberal spirit. For
such a purpose, Boston itself was a good place to live in: it was
too large to be wholly provincial, and it was not so large that the
individual was lost; and at that time it was moreover the literary
centre of America. When Phillips Brooks entered Harvard, he came
into an atmosphere of intense intellectual activity. James Walker
was the president of the college, and Lowell, Holmes, Agassiz, and
Longfellow were among the professors. He graduated with honor in
1855, and soon after entered the Episcopal theological seminary at
Alexandria, Virginia.</p>
<p>The transition from Harvard to this college was an abrupt one.
The standards of the North and South were radically different. The
theology of the Church in Virginia, while tolerant to that of other
denominations, was uncompromisingly hostile to what it regarded as
heterodox.</p>
<p>When the War was declared he threw himself passionately into the
cause of the Union. Yet his affection for his Southern classmates,
men from whom he so widely differed, broadened that charity that
was one of his finest characteristics, a charity that respected
conviction wherever found.</p>
<p>No man, in truth, ever did so much to remove prejudice against a
Church that had never been popular in New England. To the old
Puritan dislike of Episcopacy and distrust of the English Church as
that of the oppressors of the colony, was added a sense of
resentment toward its sacerdotal claims and its assumption of
ecclesiastical supremacy. But he nevertheless protested against the
claim by his own communion to the title of "The American Church,"
he preached occasionally in other pulpits, he even had among his
audiences clergymen of other denominations, and he was able to
reconcile men of different creeds into concord on what is essential
in all. The breadth and depth of his teaching attracted so large a
following that he increased the strength of the Episcopal Church in
America far more than he could have done by carrying on an active
propaganda in its behalf. Under his pastorate Trinity Church,
Boston, became the centre of some of the most vigorous Christian
activity in America.</p>
<p>His first charge was the Church of the Advent, in Philadelphia;
in two years he became rector of Holy Trinity Church in the same
city. In 1869 he was called to Trinity Church, Boston, of which he
was rector until his election as bishop of Massachusetts in
1891.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give an idea of Phillips Brooks without a
word about his personality, which was almost contradictory. His
commanding figure, his wit, the charm of his conversation, and a
certain boyish gayety and naturalness, drew people to him as to a
powerful magnet. He was one of the best known men in America;
people pointed him out to strangers in his own city as they pointed
out the Common and the Bunker Hill monument. When he went to
England, where he preached before the Queen, men and women of all
classes greeted him as a friend. They thronged the churches where
he preached, not only to hear him but to see him. Many stories are
told of him; some true, some more or less apocryphal, all proving
the affectionate sympathy existing between him and his kind. It was
said of him that as soon as he entered a pulpit he was absolutely
impersonal. There was no trace of individual experience or
theological conflict by which he might be labeled. He was simply a
messenger of the truth as he held it, a mouthpiece of the gospel as
he believed it had been delivered to him.</p>

<br>
<p>Although in his seminary days his sermons were described as
vague and unpractical, Phillips Brooks was as great a preacher when
under thirty years of age as he was at any later time. His early
sermons, delivered to his first charge in Philadelphia, displayed
the same individuality, the same force and completeness and
clearness of construction, the same deep, strong undertone of
religious thought, as his great discourses preached in Westminster
Abbey six months before his death. His sentences are sonorous; his
style was characterized by a noble simplicity, impressive, but
without a touch showing that dramatic effect was strained for.</p>
<p>He passionately loved nature in all her aspects, and traveled
widely in search of the picturesque; but he used his experience
with reserve, and his illustrations are used to explain human life.
His power of painting a picture in a few bold strokes appears
strikingly in the great sermon on the 'Lesson of the Life of Saul,'
where he contrasts early promise and final failure; and in that
other not less remarkable presentation of the vision of Saint
Peter. His treatment of Bible narratives is not a translation into
the modern manner, nor is it an adaptation, but a poetical
rendering, in which the flavor of the original is not lost though
the lesson is made contemporary. And while he did not transcribe
nature upon his pages, his sermons are not lacking in decoration.
He used figures of speech and drew freely on history and art for
illustrations, but not so much to elucidate his subject as to
ornament it. His essays on social and literary subjects are written
with the aim of directness of statement, pure and simple; but the
stuff of which his sermons are woven is of royal purple.</p>
<p>The conviction that religious sentiment should penetrate the
whole life showed itself in Phillips Brooks's relation to
literature. "Truth bathed in light and uttered in love makes the
new unit of power," he says in his essay on literature. It was his
task to mediate between literature and theology, and restore
theology to the place it lost through the abstractions of the
schoolmen. What he would have done if he had devoted himself to
literature alone, we can only conjecture by the excellence of his
style in essays and sermons. They show his poetical temperament;
and his little lyric 'O Little Town of Bethlehem' will be sung as
long as Christmas is celebrated. His essays show more clearly even
than his sermons his opinions on society, literature, and religion.
They place him where he belongs, in that "small transfigured band
the world cannot tame,"--the world of Cranmer, Jeremy Taylor,
Robertson, Arnold, Maurice. His paper on Dean Stanley discloses his
theological views as openly as do his addresses on 'Heresies and
Orthodoxy.'</p>
<p>As might be expected of one who, in the word's best sense, was
so thoroughly a man, he had great influence with young men and was
one of the most popular of Harvard preachers. It was his custom for
thirty alternate years to go abroad in the summer, and there, as in
America, he was regarded as a great pulpit orator. He took a large
view of social questions and was in sympathy with all great popular
movements. His advancement to the episcopate was warmly welcomed by
all parties, except one branch of his own church with which his
principles were at variance, and every denomination delighted in
his elevation as if he were the peculiar property of each.</p>
<p>He published several volumes of sermons. His works include
'Lectures on Preaching' (New York, 1877), 'Sermons' (1878-81),
'Bohlen Lectures' (1879), 'Baptism and Confirmation' (1880),
'Sermons Preached in English Churches' (1883), 'The Oldest Schools
in America' (Boston, 1885), 'Twenty Sermons' (New York, 1886),
'Tolerance' (1887), 'The Light of the World, and Other Sermons'
(1890), and 'Essays and Addresses' (1894). His 'Letters of Travel'
show him to be an accurate observer, with a large fund of
spontaneous humor. No letters to children are so delightful as
those in this volume.</p>

<h3>PERSONAL CHARACTER</h3>
<center>From 'Essays and Addresses'</center>
<br>
<p>As one looks around the world, and as one looks around our own
land to-day, he sees that the one thing we need in high places--the
thing whose absence, among those who hold the reins of highest
power, is making us all anxious with regard to the progress of the
country--is personal character. The trouble is not what we hold to
be mistaken ideas with regard to policies of government, but it is
the absence of lofty and unselfish character. It is the absence of
the complete consecration of a man's self to the public good; it is
the willingness of men to bring their personal and private spites
into spheres whose elevation ought to shame such things into
absolute death; the tendencies of men, even of men whom the nation
has put in very high places indeed, to count those high places
their privileges, and to try to draw from them, not help for
humanity and the community over which they rule, but their own mean
personal private advantage.</p>
<p>If there is any power that can elevate human character: if there
is any power which, without inspiring men with a supernatural
knowledge with regard to policies of government; without making men
solve all at once, intuitively, the intricacies of problems of
legislation with which they are called upon to deal; without making
men see instantly to the very heart of every matter; if there is
any power which could permeate to the very bottom of our community,
which would make men unselfish and true--why, the errors of men,
the mistakes men might make in their judgment, would not be an
obstacle in the way of the progress of this great nation in the
work which God has given her to do. They would make jolts, but
nothing more. Or in the course which God has appointed her to run
she would go to her true results. There is no power that man has
ever seen that can abide; there is no power of which man has ever
dreamed that can regenerate human character except religion; and
till the Christian religion, which is the religion of this
land--till the Christian religion shall have so far regenerated
human character in this land that multitudes of men shall act under
its high impulses and principles, so that the men who are not
inspired with them shall be shamed at least into an outward
conformity with them, there is no security for the great final
continuance of the nation.</p>

<h3>THE COURAGE OF OPINIONS</h3>
<center>From 'Essays and Addresses'</center>
<br>
<p>We have spoken of physical courage, or the courage of nerves; of
moral courage, or the courage of principles. Besides these there is
intellectual courage, or the courage of opinions. Let me say a few
words upon that, for surely there is nothing which we more need to
understand.</p>
<p>The ways in which people form their opinions are most
remarkable. Every man, when he begins his reasonable life, finds
certain general opinions current in the world. He is shaped by
these opinions in one way or another, either directly or by
reaction. If he is soft and plastic, like the majority of people,
he takes the opinions that are about him for his own. If he is
self-asserting and defiant, he takes the opposite of these opinions
and gives to them his vehement adherence. We know the two kinds
well, and as we ordinarily see them, the fault which is at the root
of both is intellectual cowardice. One man clings servilely to the
old ready-made opinions which he finds, because he is afraid of
being called rash and radical; another rejects the traditions of
his people from fear of being thought fearful, and timid, and a
slave. The results are very different: one is the tame conservative
and the other is the fiery iconoclast; but I beg you to see that
the cause in both cases is the same. Both are cowards. Both are
equally removed from that brave seeking of the truth which is not
set upon either winning or avoiding any name, which will take no
opinion for the sake of conformity and reject no opinion for the
sake of originality; which is free, therefore--free to gather its
own convictions, a slave neither to any compulsion nor to any
antagonism. Tell me, have you never seen two teachers, one of them
slavishly adopting old methods because he feared to be called
"imitator," the other crudely devising new plans because he was
afraid of seeming conservative, both of them really cowards,
neither of them really thinking out his work? ...</p>
<p>The great vice of our people in their relation to the politics
of the land is cowardice. It is not lack of intelligence: our
people know the meaning of political conditions with wonderful
sagacity. It is not low morality: the great mass of our people
apply high standards to the acts of public men. But it is
cowardice. It is the disposition of one part of our people to fall
in with current ways of working, to run with the mass; and of
another part to rush headlong into this or that new scheme or
policy of opposition, merely to escape the stigma of
conservatism.</p>

<h3>LITERATURE AND LIFE</h3>
<center>From 'Essays and Addresses'</center>
<br>
<p>Life comes before literature, as the material always comes
before the work. The hills are full of marble before the world
blooms with statues. The forests are full of trees before the sea
is thick with ships. So the world abounds in life before men begin
to reason and describe and analyze and sing, and literature is
born. The fact and the action must come first. This is true in
every kind of literature. The mind and its workings are before the
metaphysician. Beauty and romance antedate the poet. The nations
rise and fall before the historian tells their story. Nature's
profusion exists before the first scientific book is written. Even
the facts of mathematics must be true before the first diagram is
drawn for their demonstration.</p>
<p>To own and recognize this priority of life is the first need of
literature. Literature which does not utter a life already
existent, more fundamental than itself, is shallow and unreal. I
had a schoolmate who at the age of twenty published a volume of
poems called 'Life-Memories.' The book died before it was born.
There were no real memories, because there had been no life. So
every science which does not utter investigated fact, every history
which does not tell of experience, every poetry which is not based
upon the truth of things, has no real life. It does not perish; it
is never born. Therefore men and nations must live before they can
make literature. Boys and girls do not write books. Oregon and Van
Diemen's Land produce no literature: they are too busy living. The
first attempts at literature of any country, as of our own, are apt
to be unreal and imitative and transitory, because life has not yet
accumulated and presented itself in forms which recommend
themselves to literature. The wars must come, the clamorous
problems must arise, the new types of character must be evolved,
the picturesque social complication must develop, a life must come,
and then will be the true time for a literature.... Literature
grows feeble and conceited unless it ever recognizes the priority
and superiority of life, and stands in genuine awe before the
greatness of the men and of the ages which have simply lived.</p>

<p>ot only was Brockden Brown the first American man-of-letters
proper,--one writing for a living before we had any real literature
of our own,--but his work possessed a genuine power and originality
which gives it some claim to remembrance for its own sake. And it
is fair always to remember that a given product from a pioneer
indicates a far greater endowment than the same from one of a group
in a more developed age. The forerunner lacks not one thing only,
but many things, which help his successors. He lacks the mental
friction from, the emulation of, the competition with, other
writers; he lacks the stimulus and comfort of sympathetic
companionship; he lacks an audience to spur him on, and a market to
work for; lacks labor-saving conventions, training, and an
environment that heartens him instead of merely tolerating him.
Like Robinson Crusoe, he must make his tools before he can use
them. A meagre result may therefore be a proof of great
abilities.</p>

<b>Charles B. Brown</b></p>
<p>The United States in 1800 was mentally and morally a colony of
Great Britain still. A few hundred thousand white families
scattered over about as many square miles of territory, much of it
refractory wilderness with more refractory inhabitants; with no
cities of any size, and no communication save by wretched roads or
by sailing vessels; no rich old universities for centres of
culture, and no rich leisured society to enjoy it; the energies of
the people perforce absorbed in subduing material obstacles, or
solidifying a political experiment disbelieved in by the very men
who organized it;--neither time nor materials existed then for an
independent literary life, which is the growth of security and
comfort and leisure if it embraces a whole society, or of endowed
college foundations and an aristocracy if it is only of the few.
Hence American society took its literary meals at the common table
of the English-speaking race, with little or no effort at a
separate establishment. There was much writing, but mostly polemic
or journalistic. When real literature was attempted, it consisted
in general of imitations of British essays, or fiction, or poetry;
and in the last two cases not even imitations of the best models in
either. The essays were modeled on Addison; the poetry on the heavy
imitators of Pope's heroics; the fiction either on the effusive
sentimentalists who followed Richardson, or on the
pseudo-Orientalists like Walpole and Lewis, or on the
pseudo-medi&aelig;valists like Mrs. Roche and Mrs. Radcliffe. This
sort of work filled the few literary periodicals of the day, but
was not read enough to make such publications profitable even then,
and is pretty much all unreadable now.</p>
<p>Charles Brockden Brown stands in marked contrast to these
second-hand weaklings, not only by his work but still more by his
method and temper. In actual achievement he did not quite fulfill
the promise of his early books, and cannot be set high among his
craft. He was an inferior artist; and though he achieved naturalism
of matter, he clung to the theatrical artificiality of style which
was in vogue. But if he had broken away from all traditions, he
could have gained no hearing whatever; he died young--twenty years
more might have left him a much greater figure; and he wrought in
disheartening loneliness of spirit. His accomplishment was that of
a pioneer. He was the first American author to see that the true
field for his fellows was America and not Europe. He realized, as
the genius of Ch&acirc;teaubriand realized at almost the same
moment, the artistic richness of the material which lay to hand in
the silent forest vastnesses, with their unfamiliar life of man and
beast, and their possibilities of mystery enough to satisfy the
most craving. He was not the equal of the author of 'The Natchez'
and 'Atala'; but he had a fresh and daring mind. He turned away
from both the emotional orgasms and the stage claptrap of his time,
to break ground for all future American novelists. He antedated
Cooper in the field of Indian life and character; and he entered
the regions of mystic supernaturalism and the disordered human
brain in advance of Hawthorne and Poe.</p>
<p>That his choice of material was neither chance nor blind
instinct, but deliberate judgment and insight, is shown by the
preface to 'Edgar Huntly,' in which he sets forth his views:--</p>
<blockquote>"America has opened new views to the naturalist and
politician, but has seldom furnished themes to the moral-pointer.
That new springs of action and new motives of curiosity should
operate, that the field of investigation opened to us by our own
country should differ essentially from those which exist in Europe,
may be readily conceived. The sources of amusement to the fancy and
instruction to the heart that are peculiar to ourselves are equally
numerous and inexhaustible. It is the purpose of this work to
profit by some of these sources, to exhibit a series of adventures
growing out of the conditions of our country, and connected with
one of the most common and wonderful diseases of the human frame.
Puerile superstition and exploded manners, Gothic castles and
chimeras, are the materials usually employed for this end. The
incidents of Indian hostility and the perils of the Western
wilderness are far more suitable, and for a native of America to
overlook these would admit of no apology. These therefore are in
part the ingredients of this tale."</blockquote>
<p>Brown's was an uneventful career. He was much given to solitary
rambles and musings, varied by social intercourse with a few
congenial friends and the companionship of his affectionate family,
and later, many hours spent at his writing-desk or in an editorial
chair.</p>
<p>He was born January 17th, 1771, in Philadelphia, of good Quaker
stock. A delicate boyhood, keeping him away from the more active
life of youths of his own age, fostered, a love for solitude and a
taste for reading. He received a good classical education; but poor
health prevented him from pursuing his studies at college. At his
family's wish he entered a law office instead; but the literary
instinct was strong within him. Literature at this time was
scarcely considered a profession. Magazine circulations were too
limited for publishers to pay for contributions, and all an author
usually got or expected to get was some copies to distribute among
his friends. To please his prudent home circle, Brown dallied for a
while with the law; but a visit to New York, where he was cordially
received by the members of the "Friendly Club," opened up avenues
of literary work to him, and he removed to New York in 1796 to
devote himself to it.</p>
<p>The first important work he produced was 'Wieland: or the
Transformation' (1798). It shows at the outset Brown's
characteristic traits--independence of British materials and
methods. It is in substance a powerful tale of ventriloquism
operating on an unbalanced and superstitious mind. Its psychology
is acute and searching; the characterization realistic and
effective. His second book, 'Ormond: or the Secret Witness' (1799),
does not reach the level of 'Wieland.' It is more conventional, and
not entirely independent of foreign models, especially Godwin, whom
Brown greatly admired. A rapid writer, he soon had the MS. of his
next novel in the hands of the publisher. The first part of 'Arthur
Mervyn: or Memoirs of the Year 1793' came out in 1799, and the
second part in 1800. It is the best known of his six novels. Though
the scene is laid in Philadelphia, Brown embodied in it his
experience of the yellow fever which raged in New York in 1799. The
passage describing this epidemic can stand beside Defoe's or Poe's
or Manzoni's similar descriptions, for power in setting forth the
horrors of the plague.</p>
<p>In the same year with the first volume of 'Arthur Mervyn'
appeared 'Edgar Huntly: or Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker.' Here he
deals with the wild life of nature, the rugged solitudes, and the
redskins, the field in which he was followed by Cooper. A thrilling
scene in which a panther is chief actor was long familiar to
American children in their school reading-books.</p>
<p>In 1801 came out his last two novels, 'Clara Howard: In a Series
of Letters,' and 'Jane Talbot.' They are a departure from his
previous work: instead of dealing with uncanny subjects they treat
of quiet domestic and social life. They show also a great advance
on his previous books in constructive art. In 1799 Brown became
editor of the Monthly Magazine and American Review, and contributed
largely to it.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1801 he returned to Philadelphia, to assume the
editorship of Conrad's Literary Magazine and American Review. The
duties of this office suspended his own creative work, and he did
not live to take up again the novelist's stylus. In 1806 he became
editor of the Annual Register. His genuine literary force is best
proved by the fact that whatever periodical he took in charge, he
raised its standard of quality and made it a success for the
time.</p>
<p>He died in February, 1810. The work to which he had given the
greater part of his time and strength, especially toward the end of
his life, was in its nature not only transitory, but not of a sort
to keep his name alive. The magazines were children of a day, and
the editor's repute as such could hardly survive them long. The
fame which belongs to Charles Brockden Brown, grudgingly accorded
by a country that can ill afford to neglect one of its earliest,
most devoted, and most original workers, rests on his novels.
Judged by standards of the present day, these are far from
faultless. The facts are not very coherent, the diction is
artificial in the fashion of the day. But when all is said, Brown
was a rare story-teller; he interested his readers by the novelty
of his material, and he was quite objective in its treatment, never
obtruding his own personality. 'Wieland,' 'Edgar Huntly,' and
'Arthur Mervyn,' the trilogy of his best novels, are not to be
contemned; and he has the distinction of being in very truth the
pioneer of <i>American</i> letters.</p>

<h3>WIELAND'S STATEMENT</h3>
<br>
<p>Theodore Wieland, the prisoner at the bar, was now called upon
for his defense. He looked around him for some time in silence, and
with a mild countenance. At length he spoke:--</p>
<p>It is strange: I am known to my judges and my auditors. Who is
there present a stranger to the character of Wieland? Who knows him
not as a husband, as a father, as a friend? Yet here am I arraigned
as a criminal. I am charged with diabolical malice; I am accused of
the murder of my wife and my children!</p>
<p>It is true, they were slain by me; they all perished by my hand.
The task of vindication is ignoble. What is it that I am called to
vindicate? and before whom?</p>
<p>You know that they are dead, and that they were killed by me.
What more would you have? Would you extort from me a statement of
my motives? Have you failed to discover them already? You charge me
with malice: but your eyes are not shut; your reason is still
vigorous; your memory has not forsaken you. You know whom it is
that you thus charge. The habits of his life are known to you; his
treatment of his wife and his offspring is known to you; the
soundness of his integrity and the unchangeableness of his
principles are familiar to your apprehension: yet you persist in
this charge! You lead me hither manacled as a felon; you deem me
worthy of a vile and tormenting death!</p>
<p>Who are they whom I have devoted to death? My wife--the little
ones that drew their being from me--that creature who, as she
surpassed them in excellence, claimed a larger affection than those
whom natural affinities bound to my heart. Think ye that malice
could have urged me to this deed? Hide your audacious fronts from
the scrutiny of heaven. Take refuge in some cavern unvisited by
human eyes. Ye may deplore your wickedness or folly, but ye cannot
expiate it.</p>
<p>Think not that I speak for your sakes. Hug to your hearts this
detestable infatuation. Deem me still a murderer, and drag me to
untimely death. I make not an effort to dispel your illusion; I
utter not a word to cure you of your sanguinary folly: but there
are probably some in this assembly who have come from far; for
their sakes, whose distance has disabled them from knowing me, I
will tell what I have done, and why.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that God is the object of my supreme
passion. I have cherished in his presence a single and upright
heart. I have thirsted for the knowledge of his will. I have burnt
with ardor to approve my faith and my obedience. My days have been
spent in searching for the revelation of that will; but my days
have been mournful, because my search failed. I solicited
direction; I turned on every side where glimmerings of light could
be discovered. I have not been wholly uninformed; but my knowledge
has always stopped short of certainty. Dissatisfaction has
insinuated itself into all my thoughts. My purposes have been pure,
my wishes indefatigable; but not till lately were these purposes
thoroughly accomplished and these wishes fully gratified.</p>
<p>I thank Thee, my Father, for Thy bounty; that Thou didst not ask
a less sacrifice than this; that Thou placedst me in a condition to
testify my submission to Thy will! What have I withheld which it
was Thy pleasure to exact? Now may I, with dauntless and erect eye,
claim my reward, since I have given Thee the treasure of my
soul.</p>
<p>I was at my own house; it was late in the evening; my sister had
gone to the city, but proposed to return. It was in expectation of
her return that my wife and I delayed going to bed beyond the usual
hour; the rest of the family, however, were retired. My mind was
contemplative and calm--not wholly devoid of apprehension on
account of my sister's safety. Recent events, not easily explained,
had suggested the existence of some danger; but this danger was
without a distinct form in our imagination, and scarcely ruffled
our tranquillity.</p>
<p>Time passed, and my sister did not arrive. Her house is at some
distance from mine, and though her arrangements had been made with
a view of residing with us, it was possible that through
forgetfulness, or the occurrence of unforeseen emergencies, she had
returned to her own dwelling.</p>
<p>Hence it was conceived proper that I should ascertain the truth
by going thither. I went. On my way my mind was full of those ideas
which related to my intellectual condition. In the torrent of
fervid conceptions I lost sight of my purpose. Sometimes I stood
still; sometimes I wandered from my path, and experienced some
difficulty, on recovering from my fit of musing, to regain it.</p>
<p>The series of my thoughts is easily traced. At first every vein
beat with raptures known only to the man whose parental and
conjugal love is without limits, and the cup of whose desires,
immense as it is, overflows with gratification. I know not why
emotions that were perpetual visitants should now have recurred
with unusual energy. The transition was not new from sensations of
joy to a consciousness of gratitude. The Author of my being was
likewise the dispenser of every gift with which that being was
embellished. The service to which a benefactor like this was
entitled could not be circumscribed. My social sentiments were
indebted to their alliance with devotion for all their value. All
passions are base, all joys feeble, all energies malignant, which
are not drawn from this source.</p>
<p>For a time my contemplations soared above earth and its
inhabitants. I stretched forth my hands; I lifted my eyes, and
exclaimed, "Oh, that I might be admitted to thy presence! that mine
were the supreme delight of knowing Thy will and of performing
it!--the blissful privilege of direct communication with Thee, and
of listening to the audible enunciation of Thy pleasure!</p>
<p>"What task would I not undertake, what privation would I not
cheerfully endure, to testify my love of Thee? Alas! Thou hidest
Thyself from my view; glimpses only of Thy excellence and beauty
are afforded me. Would that a momentary emanation from Thy glory
would visit me! that some unambiguous token of Thy presence would
salute my senses!"</p>
<p>In this mood I entered the house of my sister. It was vacant.
Scarcely had I regained recollection of the purpose that brought me
hither. Thoughts of a different tendency had such an absolute
possession of my mind, that the relations of time and space were
almost obliterated from my understanding. These wanderings,
however, were restrained, and I ascended to her chamber. I had no
light, and might have known by external observation that the house
was without any inhabitant. With this, however, I was not
satisfied. I entered the room, and the object of my search not
appearing, I prepared to return. The darkness required some caution
in descending the stair. I stretched out my hand to seize the
balustrade, by which I might regulate my steps. How shall I
describe the lustre which at that moment burst upon my vision?</p>
<p>I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of their activity. My
eyelids were half closed, and my hands withdrawn from the
balustrade. A nameless fear chilled my veins, and I stood
motionless. This irradiation did not retire or lessen. It seemed as
if some powerful effulgence covered me like a mantle. I opened my
eyes and found all about me luminous and glowing. It was the
element of heaven that flowed around. Nothing but a fiery stream
was at first visible; but anon a shrill voice from behind called
upon me to attend.</p>
<p>I turned. It is forbidden to describe what I saw: words, indeed,
would be wanting to the task. The lineaments of that Being whose
veil was now lifted and whose visage beamed upon my sight, no hues
of pencil or of language can portray. As it spoke, the accents
thrilled to my heart:--"Thy prayers are heard. In proof of thy
faith, render me thy wife. This is the victim I choose. Call her
hither, and here let her fall." The sound and visage and light
vanished at once.</p>
<p>What demand was this? The blood of Catharine was to be shed! My
wife was to perish by my hand! I sought opportunity to attest my
virtue. Little did I expect that a proof like this would have been
demanded.</p>
<p>"My wife!" I exclaimed: "O God! substitute some other victim.
Make me not the butcher of my wife. My own blood is cheap. This
will I pour out before Thee with a willing heart; but spare, I
beseech Thee, this precious life, or commission some other than her
husband to perform the bloody deed."</p>
<p>In vain. The conditions were prescribed; the decree had gone
forth, and nothing remained but to execute it. I rushed out of the
house and across the intermediate fields, and stopped not till I
entered my own parlor. My wife had remained here during my absence,
in anxious expectation of my return with some tidings of her
sister. I had none to communicate. For a time I was breathless with
my speed. This, and the tremors that shook my frame, and the
wildness of my looks, alarmed her. She immediately suspected some
disaster to have happened to her friend, and her own speech was as
much overpowered by emotion as mine. She was silent, but her looks
manifested her impatience to hear what I had to communicate. I
spoke, but with so much precipitation as scarcely to be understood;
catching her at the same time by the arm, and forcibly pulling her
from her seat.</p>
<p>"Come along with me; fly; waste not a moment; time will be lost,
and the deed will be omitted. Tarry not, question not, but fly with
me."</p>
<p>This deportment added afresh to her alarms. Her eyes pursued
mine, and she said, "What is the matter? For God's sake, what is
the matter? Where would you have me go?"</p>
<p>My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while she spoke. I
thought upon her virtues; I viewed her as the mother of my babes;
as my wife. I recalled the purpose for which I thus urged her
attendance. My heart faltered, and I saw that I must rouse to this
work all my faculties. The danger of the least delay was
imminent.</p>
<p>I looked away from her, and, again exerting my force, drew her
toward the door. "You must go with me; indeed you must."</p>
<p>In her fright she half resisted my efforts, and again exclaimed,
"Good heaven! what is it you mean? Where go? What has happened?
Have you found Clara?"</p>
<p>"Follow me and you will see," I answered, still urging her
reluctant steps forward.</p>
<p>"What frenzy has seized you? Something must needs have happened.
Is she sick? Have you found her?"</p>
<p>"Come and see. Follow me and know for yourself."</p>
<p>Still she expostulated and besought me to explain this
mysterious behavior. I could not trust myself to answer her, to
look at her; but grasping her arm, I drew her after me. She
hesitated, rather through confusion of mind than from unwillingness
to accompany me. This confusion gradually abated, and she moved
forward, but with irresolute footsteps and continual exclamations
of wonder and terror. Her interrogations of "What was the matter?"
and "Whither was I going?" were ceaseless and vehement.</p>
<p>It was the scope of my efforts not to think; to keep up a
conflict and uproar in my mind in which all order and distinctness
should be lost; to escape from the sensations produced by her
voice. I was therefore silent. I strove to abridge this interval by
haste, and to waste all my attention in furious gesticulations.</p>
<p>In this state of mind we reached my sister's door. She looked at
the windows and saw that all was desolate. "Why come we here? There
is nobody here. I will not go in."</p>
<p>Still I was dumb; but, opening the door, I drew her into the
entry. This was the allotted scene; here she was to fall. I let go
her hand, and pressing my palms against my forehead, made one
mighty effort to work up my soul to the deed.</p>
<p>In vain; it would not be; my courage was appalled, my arms
nerveless. I muttered prayers that my strength might be aided from
above. They availed nothing.</p>
<p>Horror diffused itself over me. This conviction of my cowardice,
my rebellion, fastened upon me, and I stood rigid and cold as
marble. From this state I was somewhat relieved by my wife's voice,
who renewed her supplications to be told why we come hither and
what was the fate of my sister....</p>
<p>The fellness of a gloomy hurricane but faintly resembled the
discord that reigned in my mind. To omit this sacrifice must not
be; yet my sinews had refused to perform it. No alternative was
offered. To rebel against the mandate was impossible; but obedience
would render me the executioner of my wife. My will was strong, but
my limbs refused their office.</p>
<p>That accents and looks so winning should disarm me of my
resolution was to be expected. My thoughts were thrown anew into
anarchy. I spread my hand before my eyes that I might not see her,
and answered only by groans. She took my other hand between hers,
and pressing it to her heart, spoke with that voice which had ever
swayed my will and wafted away sorrow:--</p>
<p>"My friend! my soul's friend! tell me thy cause of grief. Do I
not merit to partake with thee in thy cares? Am I not thy
wife?"</p>
<p>This was too much. I broke from her embrace and retired to a
corner of the room. In this pause, courage was once more infused
into me. I resolved to execute my duty. She followed me, and
renewed her passionate entreaties to know the cause of my distress.
I raised my head and regarded her with steadfast looks. I muttered
something about death, and the injunctions of my duty. At these
words she shrunk back, and looked at me with a new expression of
anguish. After a pause, she clasped her hands, and
exclaimed:---</p>
<p>"O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am mistaken! but something
surely is wrong. I see it; it is too plain; thou art undone--lost
to me and to thyself." At the same time she gazed on my features
with intensest anxiety, in hope that different symptoms would take
place. I replied to her with vehemence:--</p>
<p>"Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank my God that my
cowardice is now vanquished and I have power to fulfill it.
Catharine, I pity the weakness of thy nature; I pity thee, but must
not spare. Thy life is claimed from my hands; thou must die!"</p>
<p>Fear was now added to her grief. "What mean you? Why talk you of
death? Bethink yourself, Wieland; bethink yourself, and this fit
will pass. Oh, why came I hither? Why did you drag me hither?"</p>
<p>"I brought thee hither to fulfill a divine command. I am
appointed thy destroyer, and destroy thee I must." Saying this, I
seized her wrists. She shrieked aloud, and endeavored to free
herself from my grasp; but her efforts were vain.</p>
<p>"Surely, surely, Wieland, thou dost not mean it. Am I not thy
wife? and wouldst thou kill me? Thou wilt not; and yet--I see--thou
art Wieland no longer! A fury resistless and horrible possesses
thee. Spare me--spare--help--help--"</p>
<p>Till her breath was stopped she shrieked for help, for mercy.
When she could speak no longer, her gestures, her looks appealed to
my compassion. My accursed hand was irresolute and tremulous. I
meant thy death to be sudden, thy struggles to be brief. Alas! my
heart was infirm, my resolves mutable. Thrice I slackened my grasp,
and life kept its hold, though in the midst of pangs. Her eyeballs
started from their sockets. Grimness and distortion took the place
of all that used to bewitch me into transport and subdue me into
reverence. I was commissioned to kill thee, but not to torment thee
with the foresight of thy death; not to multiply thy fears and
prolong thy agonies. Haggard and pale and lifeless, at length thou
ceasedst to contend with thy destiny.</p>
<p>This was the moment of triumph. Thus had I successfully subdued
the stubbornness of human passions: the victim which had been
demanded was given; the deed was done past recall.</p>
<p>I lifted the corpse in my arms and laid it on the bed. I gazed
upon it with delight. Such was the elation of my thoughts that I
even broke into laughter. I clapped my hands and exclaimed, "It is
done! My sacred duty is fulfilled! To that I have sacrificed, O my
God, Thy last and best gift, my wife!"</p>
<p>For a while I thus soared above frailty. I imagined I had set
myself forever beyond the reach of selfishness; but my imaginations
were false. This rapture quickly subsided. I looked again at my
wife. My joyous ebullitions vanished, and I asked myself who it was
whom I saw. Methought it could not be Catharine. It could not be
the woman who had lodged for years in my heart; who had slept
nightly in my bosom; who had borne in her womb, who had fostered at
her breast, the beings who called me father; whom I have watched
with delight, and cherished with a fondness ever new and
perpetually growing; it could not be the same. Where was her bloom?
These deadly and blood-suffused orbs but ill resemble the azure and
ecstatic tenderness of her eyes. The lucid stream that meandered
over that bosom, the glow of love that was wont to sit upon that
cheek, are much unlike these livid stains and this hideous
deformity. Alas! these were the traces of agony; the gripe of the
assassin had been here!</p>
<p>I will not dwell upon my lapse into desperate and outrageous
sorrow. The breath of heaven that sustained me was withdrawn, and I
sunk into <i>mere man</i>. I leaped from the floor; I dashed my
head against the wall; I uttered screams of horror; I panted after
torment and pain. Eternal fire and the bickerings of hell, compared
with what I felt, were music and a bed of roses.</p>
<p>I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient--that He
deigned once more to raise me aloft. I thought upon what I had done
as a sacrifice to duty, and <i>was calm</i>. My wife was dead; but
I reflected that though this source of human consolation was
closed, yet others were still open. If the transports of a husband
were no more, the feelings of a father had still scope for
exercise. When remembrance of their mother should excite too keen a
pang, I would look upon them and <i>be comforted</i>.</p>
<p>While I revolved these ideas, new warmth flowed in upon my
heart. I was wrong. These feelings were the growth of selfishness.
Of this I was not aware; and to dispel the mist that obscured my
perceptions, a new effulgence and a new mandate were necessary.
From these thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was shot into the
room. A voice spake like that which I had before heard:--"Thou hast
done well. But all is not done--the sacrifice is incomplete--thy
children must be offered--they must perish with their
mother!--"</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowest that my actions were
conformable to Thy will. I know not what is crime; what actions are
evil in their ultimate and comprehensive tendency, or what are
good. Thy knowledge, as Thy power, is unlimited. I have taken Thee
for my guide, and cannot err. To the arms of Thy protection I
intrust my safety. In the awards of Thy justice I confide for my
recompense.</p>
<p>Come death when it will, I am safe. Let calumny and abhorrence
pursue me among men; I shall not be defrauded of my dues. The peace
of virtue and the glory of obedience will be my portion
hereafter.</p>

<h2>JOHN BROWN</h2>
<h3>(1810-1882)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ohn Brown, the son of a secession-church minister, was born in
Biggar, Lanarkshire, Scotland, September 22d, 1810, and died in
Edinburgh, May 11th, 1882. He was educated at the Edinburgh High
School and at the University, and graduated in medicine in 1833.
For a time he was a surgeon's assistant to the great Dr. Syme, the
man of whom he said "he never wasted a drop of ink or blood," and
whose character he has drawn in one of his most charming
biographies. When he began to practice for himself he gradually
"got into a good connection," and his patients made him their
confidant and adviser. He was considered a fine doctor too, for he
had remarkable common-sense, and was said to be unerring in
diagnosis.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/brown_j.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>John Brown</b></p>
<p>Dr. Brown did not, as is commonly believed, dislike his
profession; but later on he took a view of it which seemed
non-progressive, and his success as a writer no doubt interfered
with his practice. His friend Professor Masson draws a pleasant
picture of him when he first settled in practice, as a dark-haired
man with soft, fine eyes and a benignant manner, the husband of a
singularly beautiful woman, and much liked and sought after in the
social circles of Edinburgh. This was partly owing to the charm of
his conversation, and partly to the literary reputation he had
achieved through some articles on the Academy exhibition and on
local artists. Though he had little technical training, he had an
eye for color and form, an appreciation of the artist's meaning,
and an instinct for discovering genius, as in the case of Noel
Paton and David Scott. He soon became an authority among artists,
and he gave a new impulse to national art.</p>
<p>He contributed largely to the North British Review. In 1855 he
published 'Hor&aelig; Subsceiv&aelig;,' which contained, among
medical biography and medico-literary papers, the immortal Scotch
idyl, 'Rab and his Friends.' Up to this time the unique personality
of the doctor, with its delightful mixture of humor and sympathy,
was known only to his own circle. The appearance of 'Rab and his
Friends' revealed it to the world. Brief as it is in form, and
simple in outline, Scotland has produced nothing so full of pure,
pathetic genius since Scott.</p>
<p>Another volume of 'Hor&aelig; Subsceiv&aelig;' appeared two
years after, and some selections from it, and others from
unpublished manuscript, were printed separately in the volume
entitled 'Spare Hours.' They met with instant and unprecedented
success. In a short time ten thousand copies of 'Minchmoor' and
'James the Doorkeeper' were sold, fifteen thousand copies of 'Pet
Marjorie,' and 'Rab' had reached its fiftieth thousand. With all
this success and praise, and constantly besought by publishers for
his work, he could not be persuaded that his writings were of any
permanent value, and was reluctant to publish. In 1882 appeared a
third volume of the 'Hor&aelig; Subsceiv&aelig;,' which included
all his writings. A few weeks after its publication he died.</p>
<p>The Doctor's medical essays, which are replete with humor, are
written in defense of his special theory, the distinction between
the active and the speculative mind. He thought there was too much
science and too little intuitive sagacity in the world, and looked
back longingly to the old-time common-sense, which he believed
modern science had driven away. His own mind was anti-speculative,
although he paid just tributes to philosophy and science and
admired their achievements. He stigmatized the speculations of the
day as the "lust of innovation." But the reader cares little for
the opinions of Dr. Brown as arguments: his subject is of little
consequence if he will but talk. By the charm of his story-telling
these dead Scotch doctors are made to live again. The death-bed of
Syme, for instance, is as pathetic as the wonderful paper on
Thackeray's death; and to-day many a heart is sore for 'Pet
Marjorie,' the ten-year-old child who died in Scotland almost a
hundred years ago.</p>
<p>As an essayist, Dr. Brown belongs to the followers of Addison
and Charles Lamb, and he blends humor, pathos, and quiet
hopefulness with a grave and earnest dignity. He delighted, not
like Lamb "in the habitable parts of the earth," but in the lonely
moorlands and pastoral hills, over which his silent, stalwart
shepherds walked with swinging stride. He had a keen appreciation
for anything he felt to be excellent: his usual question concerning
a stranger, either in literature or life, was "Has he wecht,
sir?"--quoting Dr. Chalmers; and when he wanted to give the highest
praise, he said certain writing was "strong meat." He had a warm
enthusiasm for the work of other literary men: an artist himself,
he was quick to appreciate and seize upon the witty thing or the
excellent thing wherever he found it, and he was eager to share his
pleasure with the whole world. He reintroduced to the public Henry
Vaughn, the quaint seventeenth-century poet; he wrote a sympathetic
memoir of Arthur Hallam; he imported 'Modern Painters,' and
enlightened Edinburgh as to its merits. His art papers were what
Walter Pater would call "appreciations,"--that is to say, he dwelt
upon the beauties of what he described rather than upon the
defects. What he did not admire he left alone.</p>
<p>As the author of 'Rab' loved the lonely glens on Minchmoor and
in the Enterkin, or where Queen Mary's "baby garden" shows its
box-row border among the Spanish chestnuts of Lake Monteith, so he
loved the Scottish character, "bitter to the taste and sweet to the
diaphragm": "Jeemes" the beadle, with his family worship when he
himself was all the family; the old Aberdeen Jacobite people; Miss
Stirling Graham of Duntrune, who in her day bewitched Edinburgh;
Rab, Ailie, and Bob Ainslie. His characters are oddities, but are
drawn without a touch of cynicism. What an amount of playful,
wayward nonsense lies between these pages, and what depths of
melancholy under the fun! Like Sir Walter, he had a great love for
dogs, and never went out unaccompanied by one or two of them. They
are the heroes of several of his sketches.</p>
<p>Throughout the English-speaking world, he was affectionately
known as Dr. John Brown of Edinburgh. He stood aloof from political
and ecclesiastical controversies, and was fond of telling a story
to illustrate how little reasoning went to forming partisans. A
minister catechizing a raw plowboy, after asking the first
question, "Who made you?" and getting the answer "God," asked him,
"How do you know that God made you?" After some pause and
head-scratching, the reply came, "Weel, sir, it's the clash [common
talk] o' the kintry." "Ay," Brown added, "I'm afraid that a deal of
our belief is founded on just 'the clash o' the kintry.'"</p>

<h3>MARJORIE FLEMING</h3>
<center>From 'Spare Hours'</center>
<br>
<p>One November afternoon in 1810--the year in which 'Waverley' was
resumed and laid aside again, to be finished off, its last two
volumes in three weeks, and made immortal in 1814; and when its
author, by the death of Lord Melville, narrowly escaped getting a
civil appointment in India--three men, evidently lawyers, might
have been seen escaping like schoolboys from the Parliament House,
and speeding arm-in-arm down Bank Street and the Mound in the teeth
of a surly blast of sleet.</p>
<p>The three friends sought the <i>bield</i> of the low wall old
Edinburgh boys remember well, and sometimes miss now, as they
struggle with the stout west wind....</p>
<p>The third we all know. What has he not done for every one of us?
Who else ever, except Shakespeare, so diverted mankind, entertained
and entertains a world so liberally, so wholesomely? We are fain to
say not even Shakespeare, for his is something deeper than
diversion, something higher than pleasure; and yet who would care
to split this hair?</p>
<p>Had any one watched him closely before and after the parting,
what a change he would see! The bright, broad laugh, the shrewd,
jovial word, the man of the Parliament House and of the world; and
next step, moody, the light of his eye withdrawn, as if seeing
things that were invisible; his shut mouth like a child's, so
impressionable, so innocent, so sad; he was now all within, as
before he was all without; hence his brooding look. As the snow
blattered in his face, he muttered, "How it raves and drifts!
On-ding o' snaw,--ay, that's the word,--on-ding--" He was now at
his own door, "Castle Street, No. 39." He opened the door and went
straight to his den; that wondrous workshop, where in one year,
1823, when he was fifty-two, he wrote 'Peveril of the Peak,'
'Quentin Durward,' and 'St. Ronan's Well,' besides much else. We
once took the foremost of our novelists--the greatest, we would
say, since Scott--into this room, and could not but mark the
solemnizing effect of sitting where the great magician sat so often
and so long, and looking out upon that little shabby bit of sky,
and that back green where faithful dog Camp lies.</p>
<p>He sat down in his large green morocco elbow-chair, drew himself
close to his table, and glowered and gloomed at his writing
apparatus, "a very handsome old box, richly carved, lined with
crimson velvet, and containing ink-bottles, taper-stand, etc., in
silver, the whole in such order that it might have come from the
silversmith's window half an hour before." He took out his paper,
then starting up angrily, said, "'Go spin, you jade, go spin.' No,
d---- it, it won't do,--</p>
<blockquote>"'My spinnin' wheel is auld and stiff,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock o't wunna stand, sir;<br>
To keep the temper-pin in tiff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Employs ower aft my hand, sir.'</blockquote>
<p>I am off the fang. I can make nothing of 'Waverley' to-day; I'll
awa' to Marjorie. Come wi' me, Maida, you thief." The great
creature rose slowly, and the pair were off, Scott taking a
<i>maud</i> (a plaid) with him. "White as a frosted plum-cake, by
jingo!" said he, when he got to the street. Maida gamboled and
whisked among the snow, and his master strode across to Young
Street, and through it to 1 North Charlotte Street, to the house of
his dear friend, Mrs. William Keith, of Corstorphine Hill; niece of
Mrs. Keith of Ravelston, of whom he said at her death, eight years
after, "Much tradition, and that of the best, has died with this
excellent old lady, one of the few persons whose spirits, and
<i>cleanliness</i> and freshness of mind and body, made old age
lovely and desirable."</p>
<p>Sir Walter was in that house almost every day, and had a key, so
in he and the hound went, shaking themselves in the lobby.
"Marjorie! Marjorie!" shouted her friend, "where are ye, my bonnie
wee croodlin' doo?" In a moment a bright, eager child of seven was
in his arms, and he was kissing her all over. Out came Mrs. Keith.
"Come your ways in, Wattie." "No, not now. I am going to take
Marjorie wi' me, and you may come to your tea in Duncan Roy's
sedan, and bring the bairn home in your lap." "Tak' Marjorie, and
it <i>on-ding o' snaw</i>!" said Mrs. Keith. He said to himself,
"On-ding,'--that's odd,--that is the very word. Hoot, awa'! look
here," and he displayed the corner of his plaid, made to hold lambs
[the true shepherd's plaid, consisting of two breadths sewed
together, and uncut at one end, making a poke or
<i>cul-de-sac</i>]. "Tak' your lamb," said she, laughing at the
contrivance, and so the Pet was first well happit up, and then put,
laughing silently, into the plaid neuk, and the shepherd strode off
with his lamb,--Maida gamboling through the snow, and running races
in her mirth.</p>
<p>Didn't he face "the angry airt," and make her bield his bosom,
and into his own room with her, and lock the door, and out with the
warm rosy little wifie, who took it all with great composure! There
the two remained for three or more hours, making the house ring
with their laughter; you can fancy the big man's and Maidie's
laugh. Having made the fire cheery, he set her down in his ample
chair, and standing sheepishly before her, began to say his lesson,
which happened to be,--"Ziccotty, diccotty, dock, the mouse ran up
the clock; the clock struck one, down the mouse ran, ziccotty,
diccotty, dock." This done repeatedly till she was pleased, she
gave him his new lesson, gravely and slowly, timing it upon her
small fingers,--he saying it after her,--</p>
<blockquote>"Wonery, twoery, tickery, seven;<br>
Alibi, crackaby, ten and eleven;<br>
Pin, pan, musky dan;<br>
Tweedle-um, twoddle-um, twenty-wan;<br>
Eerie, orie, ourie,<br>
You, are, out."</blockquote>
<p>He pretended to great difficulty, and she rebuked him with most
comical gravity, treating him as a child. He used to say that when
he came to Alibi Crackaby he broke down, and Pin-Pan, Musky-Dan,
Tweedle-um Twoddle-um made him roar with laughter. He said
Musky-Dan especially was beyond endurance, bringing up an Irishman
and his hat fresh from the Spice Islands and odoriferous Ind; she
getting quite bitter in her displeasure at his ill behavior and
stupidness.</p>
<p>Then he would read ballads to her in his own glorious way, the
two getting wild with excitement over 'Gil Morrice' or the 'Baron
of Smailholm'; and he would take her on his knee, and make her
repeat Constance's speech in 'King John,' till he swayed to and
fro, sobbing his fill....</p>
<p>Scott used to say that he was amazed at her power over him,
saying to Mrs. Keith, "She's the most extraordinary creature I ever
met with, and her repeating of Shakespeare overpowers me as nothing
else does."</p>
<p>Thanks to the unforgetting sister of this dear child, who has
much of the sensibility and fun of her who has been in her small
grave these fifty and more years, we have now before us the letters
and journals of Pet Marjorie,--before us lies and gleams her rich
brown hair, bright and sunny as if yesterday's, with the words on
the paper, "Cut out in her last illness," and two pictures of her
by her beloved Isabella, whom she worshiped; there are the faded
old scraps of paper, hoarded still, over which her warm breath and
her warm little heart had poured themselves; there is the old
water-mark, "Lingard, 1808." The two portraits are very like each
other, but plainly done at different times; it is a chubby, healthy
face, deep-set, brooding eyes, as eager to tell what is going on
within as to gather in all the glories from without; quick with the
wonder and the pride of life; they are eyes that would not be soon
satisfied with seeing; eyes that would devour their object, and yet
childlike and fearless. And that is a mouth that will not be soon
satisfied with love; it has a curious likeness to Scott's own,
which has always appeared to us his sweetest, most mobile and
speaking feature.</p>
<p>There she is, looking straight at us as she did at
him,--fearless and full of love, passionate, wild, willful, fancy's
child.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>There was an old servant, Jeanie Robertson, who was forty years
in her grandfather's family. Marjorie Fleming--or as she is called
in the letters and by Sir Walter, Maidie--was the last child she
kept. Jeanie's wages never exceeded &pound;3 a year, and when she
left service she had saved &pound;40. She was devotedly attached to
Maidie, rather despising and ill-using her sister Isabella, a
beautiful and gentle child. This partiality made Maidie apt at
times to domineer over Isabella. "I mention this," writes her
surviving sister, "for the purpose of telling you an instance of
Maidie's generous justice. When only five years old, when walking
in Raith grounds, the two children had run on before, and old
Jeanie remembered they might come too near a dangerous mill-lade.
She called to them to turn back. Maidie heeded her not, rushed all
the faster on, and fell, and would have been lost, had her sister
not pulled her back, saving her life, but tearing her clothes.
Jeanie flew on Isabella to 'give it her' for spoiling her
favorite's dress; Maidie rushed in between, crying out, 'Pay (whip)
Maidie as much as you like, and I'll not say one word; but touch
Isy, and I'll roar like a bull!' Years after Maidie was resting in
her grave, my mother used to take me to the place, and told the
story always in the exact same words." This Jeanie must have been a
character. She took great pride in exhibiting Maidie's brother
William's Calvinistic acquirements when nineteen months old, to the
officers of a militia regiment then quartered in Kirkcaldy. This
performance was so amusing that it was often repeated, and the
little theologian was presented by them with a cap and feathers.
Jeanie's glory was "putting him through the carritch" (catechism)
in broad Scotch, beginning at the beginning with "Wha made ye, ma
bonnie man?" For the correctness of this and the three next
replies, Jeanie had no anxiety; but the tone changed to menace, and
the closed <i>nieve</i> (fist) was shaken in the child's face as
she demanded, "Of what are you made?" "DIRT," was the answer
uniformly given. "Wull ye never learn to say <i>dust</i>, ye thrawn
deevil?" with a cuff from the opened hand, was the as inevitable
rejoinder.</p>
<p>Here is Maidie's first letter, before she was six, the spelling
unaltered, and there are no "commoes."</p>
<p>&nbsp;"MY DEAR ISA--I now sit down to answer all your kind
and<br>
beloved letters which you was so good as to write to me. This is
the first time I ever wrote a letter in my Life. There are a great
many Girls in the Square and they cry just like a pig when we are
under the painfull necessity of putting it to Death. Miss Potune a
Lady of my acquaintance praises me dreadfully. I repeated something
out of Dean Swift and she said I was fit for the stage and you may
think I was primmed up with majestick Pride but upon my word I felt
myselfe turn a little birsay--birsay is a word which is a word that
William composed which is as you may suppose a little enraged. This
horrid fat simpliton says that my Aunt is beautifull which is
intirely impossible for that is not her nature."</p>
<br>
<p>What a peppery little pen we wield! What could that have been
out of the sardonic Dean? what other child of that age would have
used "beloved" as she does? This power of affection, this faculty
of <i>be</i>loving, and wild hunger to be beloved, comes out more
and more. She periled her all upon it, and it may have been as
well--we know, indeed, that it was far better--for her that this
wealth of love was so soon withdrawn to its one only infinite Giver
and Receiver. This must have been the law of her earthly life. Love
was indeed "her Lord and King"; and it was perhaps well for her
that she found so soon that her and our only Lord and King Himself
is Love. Here are bits from her Diary at Braehead:--</p>
<p>"The day of my existence here has been delightful and
enchanting. On Saturday I expected no less than three well-made
Bucks the names of whom is here advertised. Mr. Geo. Crakey
[Craigie], and Wm. Keith and Jn. Keith--the first is the funniest
of every one of them. Mr. Crakey and I walked to Crakyhall
[Craigiehall] hand in hand in Innocence and matitation [meditation]
sweet thinking on the kind love which flows in our tender hearted
mind which is overflowing with majestic pleasure no one was ever so
polite to me in the hole state of my existence. Mr. Craky you
must-know is a great Buck and pretty good-looking."</p>
<p>"I am at Ravelston enjoying nature's fresh air. The birds are
singing sweetly--the calf doth frisk and nature shows her glorious
face."</p>
<p>Here is a confession:</p>
<p>"I confess I have been very more like a little young divil than
a creature for when Isabella went up stairs to teach me religion
and my multiplication and to be good and all my other lessons I
stamped with my foot and threw my new hat which she had made on the
ground and was sulky and was dreadfully passionate, but she never
whiped me but said Marjory go into another room and think what a
great crime you are committing letting your temper git the better
of you. But I went so sulkily that the Devil got the better of me
but she never never never whips me so that I think I would be the
better of it and the next time that I behave ill I think she should
do it for she never does it.... Isabella has given me praise for
checking my temper for I was sulky even when she was kneeling an
hole hour teaching me to write."</p>
<p>Our poor little wifie, <i>she</i> has no doubts of the
personality of the Devil!--"Yesterday I behave extremely ill in
God's most holy church for I would never attend myself nor let
Isabella attend which was a great crime for she often, often tells
me that when to or three are geathered together God is in the midst
of them, and it was the very same Divil that tempted Job that
tempted me I am sure; but he resisted Satan though he had boils and
many many other misfortunes which I have escaped.... I am now going
to tell you the horible and wretched plaege that my multiplication
gives me you can't conceive it the most Devilish thing is 8 times 8
and 7 times 7 it is what nature itself cant endure."</p>
<p>This is delicious; and what harm is there in her "Devilish"? it
is strong language merely; even old Rowland Hill used to say "he
grudged the Devil those rough and ready words." "I walked to that
delightful place Crakyhall with a delightful young man beloved by
all his friends especially by me his loveress, but I must not talk
any more about him for Isa said it is not proper for to speak of
gentalmen but I will never forget him! ... I am very very glad that
satan has not given me boils and many other misfortunes--In the
holy bible these words are written that the Devil goes like a
roaring lyon in search of his pray but the lord lets us escape from
him but we" (<i>pauvre petite</i>!) "do not strive with this awfull
Spirit.... To-day I pronounced a word which should never come out
of a lady's lips it was that I called John a Impudent Bitch. I will
tell you what I think made me in so bad a humor is I got one or two
of that bad sina [senna] tea to-day,"--a better excuse for bad
humor and bad language than most.</p>
<p>She has been reading the Book of Esther:--"It was a dreadful
thing that Haman was hanged on the very gallows which he had
prepared for Mordecai to hang him and his ten sons thereon and it
was very wrong and cruel to hang his sons for they did not commit
the crime; <i>but then Jesus was not then come to teach us to be
merciful</i>." This is wise and beautiful,--has upon it the very
dew of youth and holiness. Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
He perfects his praise.</p>
<p>"This is Saturday and I am very glad of it because I have play
half the Day and I get money too but alas I owe Isabella 4 pence
for I am finned 2 pence whenever I bite my nails. Isabella is
teaching me to make simmecoling nots of interrigations peorids
commoes, etc.... As this is Sunday I will meditate upon Senciable
and Religious subjects. First I should be very thankful I am not a
beggar."</p>
<p>This amount of meditation and thankfulness seems to have been
all she was able for.</p>
<p>"I am going to-morrow to a delightfull place, Braehead by name,
belonging to Mrs. Crraford, where there is ducks cocks hens
bubblyjocks 2 dogs 2 cats and swine which is delightful. I think it
is shocking to think that the dog and cat should bear them" (this
is a meditation physiological) "and they are drowned after all. I
would rather have a man-dog than a woman-dog, because they do not
bear like woman-dogs; it is a hard case--it is shocking. I came
here to enjoy natures delightful breath it is sweeter than a fial
of rose oil."</p>
<p>Braehead is the farm the historical Jock Howison asked and got
from our gay James the Fifth, "the gudeman o' Ballengiech," as a
reward for the services of his flail when the King had the worst of
it at Cramond Brig with the gipsies. The farm is unchanged in size
from that time, and still in the unbroken line of the ready and
victorious thrasher. Braehead is held on the condition of the
possessor being ready to present the King with a ewer and basin to
wash his hands, Jock having done this for his unknown king after
the <i>splore</i>; and when George the Fourth came to Edinburgh,
this ceremony was performed in silver at Holyrood.</p>
<p>It is a lovely neuk, this Braehead, preserved almost as it was
two hundred years ago. "Lot and his wife," mentioned by
Maidie,--two quaintly cropped yew-trees,--still thrive; the burn
runs as it did in her time, and sings the same quiet tune,--as much
the same and as different as <i>Now</i> and <i>Then</i>. The house
is full of old family relics and pictures, the sun shining on them
through the small deep windows with their plate-glass; and there,
blinking at the sun and chattering contentedly, is a parrot, that
might, for its looks of eld, have been in the ark, and domineered
over and <i>deaved</i> the dove. Everything about the place is old
and fresh.</p>
<p>This is beautiful:--"I am very sorry to say that I forgot
God--that is to say I forgot to pray to-day and Isabella told me
that I should be thankful that God did not forget me--if he did, O
what would become of me if I was in danger and God not friends with
me--I must go to unquenchable fire and if I was tempted to sin--how
could I resist it O no I will never do it again--no no--if I can
help it." (Canny wee wifie!) "My religion is greatly falling off
because I dont pray with so much attention when I am saying my
prayers, and my charecter is lost among the Braehead people. I hope
I will be religious again--but as for regaining my charecter I
despare for it." [Poor little "habit and repute"!]</p>
<p>Her temper, her passion, and her "badness" are almost daily
confessed and deplored:--"I will never again trust to my own power,
for I see that I cannot be good without God's assistance--. I will
not trust in my own selfe, and Isa's health will be quite ruined by
me--it will indeed." "Isa has giving me advice, which is, that when
I feel Satan beginning to tempt me, that I flea him and he would
flea me." "Remorse is the worst thing to bear, and I am afraid that
I will fall a marter to it."</p>
<p>Poor dear little sinner!--Here comes the world again:--"In my
travels I met with a handsome lad named Charles Balfour Esq., and
from him I got ofers of marage--offers of marage, did I say? Nay
plenty heard me." A fine scent for "breach of promise"!</p>
<p>This is abrupt and strong:--"The Divil is curced and all works.
'Tis a fine work 'Newton on the profecies.' I wonder if there is
another book of poems comes near the Bible. The Divil always girns
at the sight of the Bible." "Miss Potune" (her "simpliton" friend)
"is very fat; she pretends to be very learned. She says she saw a
stone that dropt from the skies; but she is a good Christian."</p>
<p>Here come her views on church government:--"An Anni-babtist is a
thing I am not a member of--I am a Pisplekan (Episcopalian) just
now, and" (O you little Laodicean and Latitudinarian!) "a
Prisbeteran at Kirkcaldy"--<i>(Blandula! Vagula! coelum et animum
mutas quoe trans mare</i> [i.e., <i>trans Bodotriam]
curris!</i>)--"my native town."</p>
<p>"Sentiment is not what I am acquainted with as yet, though I
wish it, and should like to practise it" (!) "I wish I had a great,
great deal of gratitude in my heart, in all my body." There is a
new novel published, named 'Self-Control' (Mrs. Brunton's)--"a very
good maxim forsooth!"</p>
<p>This is shocking:--"Yesterday a marrade man, named Mr. John
Balfour, Esq., offered to kiss me, and offered to marry me, though
the man" (a fine directness this!) "was espused, and his wife was
present and said he must ask her permission; but he did not. I
think he was ashamed and confounded before 3 gentelman--Mr. Jobson
and 2 Mr. Kings." "Mr. Banesters" (Bannister's) "Budjet is
to-night; I hope it will be a good one. A great many authors have
expressed themselves too sentimentally." You are right, Marjorie.
"A Mr. Burns writes a beautiful song on Mr. Cunhaming, whose wife
desarted him--truly it is a most beautiful one." "I like to read
the Fabulous historys, about the histerys of Robin, Dickey,
flapsay, and Peccay, and it is very amusing, for some were good
birds and others bad, but Peccay was the most dutiful and obedient
to her parients." "Thomson is a beautiful author, and Pope, but
nothing to Shakespear, of which I have a little knolege. 'Macbeth'
is a pretty composition, but awful one." "The 'Newgate Calender' is
very instructive."(!)</p>
<p>"A sailor called here to say farewell; it must be dreadful to
leave his native country when he might get a wife; or perhaps me,
for I love him very much. But O I forgot, Isabella forbid me to
speak about love." This antiphlogistic regimen and lesson is ill to
learn by our Maidie, for here she sins again:--"Love is a very
papithatick thing" (it is almost a pity to correct this into
pathetic), "as well as troublesome and tiresome--but O Isabella
forbid me to speak of it."</p>
<p>Here are her reflections on a pineapple:--"I think the price of
a pineapple is very dear: it is a whole bright goulden guinea, that
might have sustained a poor family." Here is a new vernal
simile:--"The hedges are sprouting like chicks from the eggs when
they are newly hatched or, as the vulgar say, <i>clacked</i>".
"Doctor Swift's works are very funny; I got some of them by heart."
"Moreheads sermons are I hear much praised, but I never read
sermons of any kind; but I read novelettes and my Bible, and I
never forget it, or my prayers." Brava, Marjorie!</p>
<p>She seems now, when still about six, to have broken out into
song:--</p>
<blockquote>EPHIBOL [EPIGRAM OR EPITAPH--WHO KNOWS WHICH?] ON MY
DEAR LOVE ISABELLA.<br>
<br>
"Here lies sweet Isabel in bed,<br>
With a night-cap on her head;<br>
Her skin is soft, her face is fair,<br>
And she has very pretty hair;<br>
She and I in bed lies nice,<br>
And undisturbed by rats or mice.<br>
She is disgusted with Mr. Worgan,<br>
Though he plays upon the organ.<br>
Her nails are neat, her teeth are white,<br>
Her eyes are very, very bright.<br>
In a conspicuous town she lives,<br>
And to the poor her money gives.<br>
Here ends sweet Isabella's story,<br>
And may it be much to her glory."</blockquote>
<p>Here are some bits at random:--</p>
<blockquote>"Of summer I am very fond,<br>
And love to bathe into a pond:<br>
The look of sunshine dies away,<br>
And will not let me out to play;<br>
I love the morning's sun to spy<br>
Glittering through the casement's eye;<br>
The rays of light are very sweet,<br>
And puts away the taste of meat;<br>
The balmy breeze comes down from heaven,<br>
And makes us like for to be living."</blockquote>
<p>"The casawary is an curious bird, and so is the gigantic crane,
and the pelican of the wilderness, whose mouth holds a bucket of
fish and water. Fighting is what ladies is not qualyfied for, they
would not make a good figure in battle or in a duel. Alas! we
females are of little use to our country. The history of all the
malcontents as ever was hanged is amusing." Still harping on the
Newgate Calendar!</p>
<p>"Braehead is extremely pleasant to me by the companie of swine,
geese, cocks, etc., and they are the delight of my soul."</p>
<p>"I am going to tell you of a melancholy story. A young turkie of
two or three months old, would you believe it, the father broke its
leg, and he killed another! I think he ought to be transported or
hanged."</p>
<p>"Queen Street is a very gay one, and so is Princes Street, for
all the lads and lasses, besides bucks and beggars, parade
there"</p>
<p>"I should like to see a play very much, for I never saw one in
all my life, and don't believe I ever shall; but I hope I can be
content without going to one. I can be quite happy without my
desire being granted."</p>
<p>"Some days ago Isabella had a terrible fit of the toothake, and
she walked with a long night-shift at dead of night like a ghost,
and I thought she was one. She prayed for nature's sweet
restorer--balmy sleep--but did not get it--a ghostly figure indeed
she was, enough to make a saint tremble. It made me quiver and
shake from top to toe. Superstition is a very mean thing, and
should be despised and shunned."</p>
<p>Here is her weakness and her strength again:--"In the
love-novels all the heroines are very desperate. Isabella will not
allow me to speak about lovers and heroins, and 'tis too refined
for my taste." "Miss Egward's [Edgeworth's] tails are very good,
particularly some that are very much adapted for youth (!) as Laz
Laurance and Tarelton, False Keys, etc., etc."</p>
<p>"Tom Jones and Gray's Elegey in a country churchyard are both
excellent, and much spoke of by both sex, particularly by the men."
Are our Marjories now-a-days better or worse, because they cannot
read 'Tom Jones' unharmed? More better than worse; but who among
them can repeat Gray's 'Lines on a Distant Prospect of Eton
College' as could our Maidie?</p>
<p>Here is some more of her prattle:--"I went into Isabella's bed
to make her smile like the Genius Demedicus [the Venus de' Medicis]
or the statute in an ancient Greece, but she fell asleep in my very
face, at which my anger broke forth, so that I awoke her from a
comfortable nap. All was now hushed up again, but again my anger
burst forth at her biding me get up."</p>
<p>She begins thus loftily,--</p>
<blockquote>"Death the righteous love to see,<br>
But from it doth the wicked flee."</blockquote>
<p>Then suddenly breaks off [as if with laughter],--</p>
<p>"I am sure they fly as fast as their legs can carry them!"</p>
<blockquote>"There is a thing I love to see,<br>
That is our monkey catch a flee."<br>
<br>
"I love in Isa's bed to lie,<br>
Oh, such a joy and luxury!<br>
The bottom of the bed I sleep,<br>
And with great care within I creep;<br>
Oft I embrace her feet of lillys,<br>
But she has goton all the pillys.<br>
Her neck I never can embrace,<br>
But I do hug her feet in place."</blockquote>
<p>How childish and yet how strong and free is her use of
words!--"I lay at the foot of the bed because Isabella said I
disturbed her by continial fighting and kicking, but I was very
dull, and continially at work reading the Arabian Nights, which I
could not have done if I had slept at the top. I am reading the
Mysteries of Udolpho. I am much interested in the fate of poor,
poor Emily."</p>
<p>Here is one of her swains:--</p>
<blockquote>"Very soft and white his cheeks,<br>
His hair is red, and gray his breeks;<br>
His tooth is like the daisy fair,<br>
His only fault is in his hair."</blockquote>
<p>This is a higher flight:--</p>
<blockquote>DEDICATED TO MRS. H. CRAWFORD BY THE AUTHOR, M.F.<br>
<br>
"Three turkeys fair their last have breathed,<br>
And now this world forever leaved;<br>
Their father, and their mother too,<br>
They sigh and weep as well as you;<br>
Indeed, the rats their bones have crunched,<br>
Into eternity theire laanched.<br>
A direful death indeed they had,<br>
As wad put any parent mad;<br>
But she was more than usual calm:<br>
She did not give a single dam."</blockquote>
<p>This last word is saved from all sin by its tender age, not to
speak of the want of the <i>n</i>. We fear "she" is the abandoned
mother, in spite of her previous sighs and tears.</p>
<p>"Isabella says when we pray we should pray fervently, and not
rattel over a prayer--for that we are kneeling at the foot-stool of
our Lord and Creator, who saves us from eternal damnation, and from
unquestionable fire and brimston."</p>
<p>She has a long poem on Mary Queen of Scots:--</p>
<blockquote>"Queen Mary was much loved by all,<br>
Both by the great and by the small,<br>
But hark! her soul to heaven doth rise?<br>
And I suppose she has gained a prize;<br>
For I do think she would not go<br>
Into the <i>awful</i> place below.<br>
There is a thing that I must tell--<br>
Elizabeth went to fire and hell!<br>
He who would teach her to be civil,<br>
It must be her great friend, the divil!"</blockquote>
<p>She hits off Darnley well:--</p>
<blockquote>"A noble's son,--a handsome lad,--<br>
By some queer way or other, had<br>
Got quite the better of her heart;<br>
With him she always talked apart:<br>
Silly he was, but very fair;<br>
A greater buck was not found there."</blockquote>
<p>"By some queer way or other": is not this the general case and
the mystery, young ladies and gentlemen? Goethe's doctrine of
"elective affinities" discovered by our Pet Maidie!</p>
<blockquote>SONNET TO A MONKEY<br>
<br>
O lively, O most charming pug:<br>
Thy graceful air and heavenly mug!<br>
The beauties of his mind do shine,<br>
And every bit is shaped and fine.<br>
Your teeth are whiter than the snow;<br>
Your a great buck, your a great beau;<br>
Your eyes are of so nice a shape,<br>
More like a Christian's than an ape;<br>
Your cheek is like the rose's blume;<br>
Your hair is like the raven's plume;<br>
His nose's cast is of the Roman:<br>
He is a very pretty woman.<br>
I could not get a rhyme for Roman,<br>
So was obliged to call him woman.</blockquote>
<p>This last joke is good. She repeats it when writing of James the
Second being killed at Roxburgh:--</p>
<blockquote>He was killed by a cannon splinter,<br>
Quite in the middle of the winter;<br>
Perhaps it was not at that time,<br>
But I can get no other rhyme.</blockquote>
<p>Here is one of her last letters, dated Kirkcaldy, 12th October,
1811. You can see how her nature is deepening and enriching:--</p>
<blockquote>MY DEAR MOTHER--You will think that I entirely forget
you but I assure you that you are greatly mistaken. I think of you
always and often sigh to think of the distance between us two
loving creatures of nature. We have regular hours for all our
occupations first at 7 o'clock we go to the dancing and come home
at 8 we then read our Bible and get our repeating and then play
till ten then we get our music till 11 when we get our writing and
accounts we sew from 12 till 1 after which I get my gramer and then
work till five. At 7 we come and knit till 8 when we dont go to the
dancing. This is an exact description. I must take a hasty farewell
to her whom I love, reverence and doat on and who I hope thinks the
same of<br>
<br>
MARJORY FLEMING.<br>
<br>
P.S.--An old pack of cards (!) would be very
exceptible.</blockquote>
<p>This other is a month earlier:--</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAR LITTLE MAMA--I was truly happy to hear that
you were all well. We are surrounded with measles at present on
every side, for the Herons got it, and Isabella Heron was near
Death's Door, and one night her father lifted her out of bed, and
she fell down as they thought lifeless. Mr. Heron said, 'That
lassie's deed noo'--'I'm no deed yet.' She then threw up a big worm
nine inches and a half long. I have begun dancing, but am not very
fond of it, for the boys strikes and mocks me.--I have been another
night at the dancing; I like it better. I will write to you as
often as I can; but I am afraid not every week. <i>I long for you
with the longings of a child to embrace you--to fold you in my
arms. I respect you with all the respect due to a mother. You don't
know how I love you. So I shall remain, your loving child</i>,<br>
<br>
M. FLEMING."</blockquote>
<p>What rich involution of love in the words marked! Here are some
lines to her beloved Isabella, in July, 1811:--</p>
<blockquote>"There is a thing that I do want--<br>
With you these beauteous walks to haunt;<br>
We would be happy if you would<br>
Try to come over if you could.<br>
Then I would all quite happy be<br>
<i>Now and for all eternity</i>.<br>
My mother is so very sweet,<br>
<i>And checks my appetite to eat</i>;<br>
My father shows us what to do;<br>
But O I'm sure that I want you.<br>
I have no more of poetry;<br>
O Isa do remember me,<br>
And try to love your Marjory."</blockquote>
<p>In a letter from "Isa" to</p>
<blockquote>Miss Muff Maidie Marjory Fleming,<br>
favored by Rare Rear-Admiral Fleming,"</blockquote>
<p>she says:--"I long much to see you, and talk over all our old
stories together, and to hear you read and repeat. I am pining for
my old friend Cesario, and poor Lear, and wicked Richard. How is
the dear Multiplication table going on? are you still as much
attached to 9 times 9 as you used to be?"</p>
<p>But this dainty, bright thing is about to flee,--to come "quick
to confusion." The measles she writes of seized her, and she died
on the 19th of December, 1811. The day before her death, Sunday,
she sat up in bed, worn and thin, her eye gleaming as with the
light of a coming world, and with a tremulous, old voice repeated
the lines by Burns,--heavy with the shadow of death, and lit with
the fantasy of the judgment-seat,--the publican's prayer in
paraphrase:--</p>
<blockquote>Why am I loth to leave this earthly scene</blockquote>
<p>It is more affecting than we care to say to read her mother's
and Isabella Keith's letters, written immediately after her death.
Old and withered, tattered and pale, they are now: but when you
read them, how quick, how throbbing with life and love! how rich in
that language of affection which only women and Shakespeare and
Luther can use,--that power of detaining the soul over the beloved
object and its loss....</p>
<p>In her first letter to Miss Keith, Mrs. Fleming says of her dead
Maidie:--"Never did I behold so beautiful an object. It resembled
the finest wax-work. There was in the countenance an expression of
sweetness and serenity which seemed to indicate that the pure
spirit had anticipated the joys of heaven ere it quitted the mortal
frame. To tell you what your Maidie said of you would fill volumes;
for you were the constant theme of her discourse, the subject of
her thoughts, and ruler of her actions. The last time she mentioned
you was a few hours before all sense save that of suffering was
suspended, when she said to Dr. Johnstone, 'If you will let me out
at the New Year, I will be quite contented.' I asked what made her
so anxious to get out then. 'I want to purchase a New Year's gift
for Isa Keith with the sixpence you gave me for being patient in
the measles; and I would like to choose it myself.' I do not
remember her speaking afterwards, except to complain of her head,
till just before she expired, when she articulated, 'O mother!
mother!'"</p>
<p>Do we make too much of this little child, who has been in her
grave in Abbotshall. Kirkyard these fifty and more years? We may of
her cleverness,--not of her affectionateness, her nature. What a
picture the <i>animosa infans</i> gives us of herself, her
vivacity, her passionateness, her precocious love-making, her
passion for nature, for swine, for all living things, her reading,
her turn for expression, her satire, her frankness, her little sins
and rages, her great repentances. We don't wonder Walter Scott
carried her off in the neuk of his plaid, and played himself with
her for hours....</p>
<p>We are indebted for the following--and our readers will be not
unwilling to share our obligations--to her sister:--"Her birth was
15th January, 1803; her death 19th December, 1811. I take this from
her Bibles. I believe she was a child of robust health, of much
vigor of body, and beautifully formed arms, and until her last
illness, never was an hour in bed. She was niece to Mrs. Keith,
residing in No. 1 North Charlotte Street, who was <i>not</i> Mrs.
Murray Keith, although very intimately acquainted with that old
lady....</p>
<p>"As to my aunt and Scott, they were on a very intimate footing.
He asked my aunt to be godmother to his eldest daughter Sophia
Charlotte. I had a copy of Miss Edgeworth's 'Rosamond' and 'Harry
and Lucy' for long, which was 'a gift to Marjorie from Walter
Scott,' probably the first edition of that attractive series, for
it wanted 'Frank,' which is always now published as part of the
series under the title of 'Early Lessons.' I regret to say these
little volumes have disappeared."</p>
<p>Sir Walter was no relation of Marjorie's, but of the Keiths,
through the Swintons; and like Marjorie, he stayed much at
Ravelstone in his early days, with his grand-aunt Mrs.
Keith....</p>
<p>We cannot better end than in words from this same pen:--"I have
to ask you to forgive my anxiety in gathering up the fragments of
Marjorie's last days, but I have an almost sacred feeling to all
that pertains to her. You are quite correct in stating that measles
were the cause of her death. My mother was struck by the patient
quietness manifested by Marjorie during this illness, unlike her
ardent, impulsive nature; but love and poetic feeling were
unquenched. When lying very still, her mother asked her if there
was anything she wished: 'Oh yes! if you would just leave the room
door open a wee bit, and play 'The Land o' the Leal,' and I will
lie and <i>think</i>, and enjoy myself' (this is just as stated to
me by her mother and mine). Well, the happy day came, alike to
parents and child, when Marjorie was allowed to come forth from the
nursery to the parlor. It was Sabbath evening, and after tea. My
father, who idolized this child, and never afterwards in my hearing
mentioned her name, took her in his arms; and while walking up and
down the room, she said, 'Father, I will repeat something to you;
what would you like?' He said, 'Just choose yourself, Maidie.' She
hesitated for a moment between the paraphrase 'Few are thy days,
and full of woe,' and the lines of Burns already quoted, but
decided on the latter, a remarkable choice for a child. The
repeating these lines seemed to stir up the depths of feeling in
her soul. She asked to be allowed to write a poem; there was a
doubt whether it would be right to allow her, in case of hurting
her eyes. She pleaded earnestly, 'Just this once;' the point was
yielded, her slate was given her, and with great rapidity she wrote
an address of fourteen lines, 'To her loved cousin on the author's
recovery,' her last work on earth:--</p>
<blockquote>'Oh! Isa, pain did visit me,<br>
I was at the last extremity;<br>
How often did I think of you,<br>
I wished your graceful form to view,<br>
To clasp you in my weak embrace,<br>
Indeed I thought I'd run my race:<br>
Good care, I'm sure, was of me taken,<br>
But still indeed I was much shaken.<br>
At last I daily strength did gain,<br>
And oh! at last, away went pain;<br>
At length the doctor thought I might<br>
Stay in the parlor all the night;<br>
I now continue so to do;<br>
Farewell to Nancy and to you.'</blockquote>
<p>She went to bed apparently well, awoke in the middle of the
night with the old cry of woe to a mother's heart, 'My head, my
head!' Three days of the dire malady 'water in the head' followed,
and the end came."</p>
<blockquote>"Soft, silken primrose, fading
timelessly!"</blockquote>
<p>It is needless, it is impossible to add anything to this; the
fervor, the sweetness, the flush of poetic ecstasy, the lovely and
glowing eye, the perfect nature of that bright and warm
intelligence, that darling child; Lady Nairne's words, and the old
tune, stealing up from the depths of the human heart, deep calling
unto deep, gentle and strong like the waves of the great sea
hushing themselves to sleep in the dark; the words of Burns
touching the kindred chord; her last numbers, "wildly sweet,"
traced with thin and eager fingers, already touched by the last
enemy and friend,--<i>moriens canit</i>,--and that love which is so
soon to be her everlasting light, is her song's burden to the
end.</p>
<blockquote>"She set as sets the morning star, which goes<br>
Not down behind the darkened west, nor hides<br>
Obscured among the tempests of the sky,<br>
But melts away into the light of heaven."</blockquote>

<h3>THE DEATH OF THACKERAY</h3>
<center>From 'Spare Hours'</center>
<br>
<p>We cannot resist here recalling one Sunday evening in December,
when he was walking with two friends along the Dean road, to the
west of Edinburgh,--one of the noblest outlets to any city. It was
a lovely evening,--such a sunset as one never forgets: a rich dark
bar of cloud hovered over the sun, going down behind the Highland
hills, lying bathed in amethystine bloom; between this cloud and
the hills there was a narrow slip of the pure ether, of a tender
cowslip color, lucid, and as if it were the very body of heaven in
its clearness; every object standing out as if etched upon the sky.
The northwest end of Corstorphine Hill, with its trees and rocks,
lay in the heart of this pure radiance, and there a wooden crane,
used in the quarry below, was so placed as to assume the figure of
a cross; there it was, unmistakable, lifted up against the
crystalline sky. All three gazed at it silently. As they gazed, he
gave utterance in a tremulous, gentle, and rapid voice, to what all
were feeling, in the word "CALVARY!" The friends walked on in
silence, and then turned to other things. All that evening he was
very gentle and serious, speaking, as he seldom did, of divine
things,--of death, of sin, of eternity, of salvation; expressing
his simple faith in God and in his Savior.</p>
<p>There is a passage at the close of the 'Roundabout Paper' No.
23, 'De Finibus,' in which a sense of the ebb of life is very
marked; the whole paper is like a soliloquy. It opens with a
drawing of Mr. Punch, with unusually mild eye, retiring for the
night; he is putting out his high-heeled shoes, and before
disappearing gives a wistful look into the passage, as if bidding
it and all else good-night. He will be in bed, his candle out, and
in darkness, in five minutes, and his shoes found next morning at
his door, the little potentate all the while in his final sleep.
The whole paper is worth the most careful study; it reveals not a
little of his real nature, and unfolds very curiously the secret of
his work, the vitality and abiding power of his own creations; how
he "invented a certain Costigan, out of scraps, heel-taps, odds and
ends of characters," and met the original the other day, without
surprise, in a tavern parlor. The following is beautiful: "Years
ago I had a quarrel with a certain well-known person (I believed a
statement regarding him which his friends imparted to me, and which
turned out to be quite incorrect). To his dying day that quarrel
was never quite made up. I said to his brother, 'Why is your
brother's soul still dark against me? <i>It is I who ought to be
angry and unforgiving, for I was in the wrong</i>.'" <i>Odisse quem
l&aelig;seris</i> was never better contravened. But what we chiefly
refer to now is the profound pensiveness of the following strain,
as if written with a presentiment of what was not then very far
off:--"Another Finis written; another milestone on this journey
from birth to the next world. Sure it is a subject for solemn
cogitation. Shall we continue this story-telling business, and be
voluble to the end of our age?" "Will it not be presently time, O
prattler, to hold your tongue?" And thus he ends:--</p>
<p>"Oh, the sad old pages, the dull old pages; oh, the cares, the
<i>ennui</i>, the squabbles, the repetitions, the old conversations
over and over again! But now and again a kind thought is recalled,
and now and again a dear memory. Yet a few chapters more, and then
the last; after which, behold Finis itself comes to an end, and the
Infinite begins."</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>He had been suffering on Sunday from an old and cruel enemy. He
fixed with his friend and surgeon to come again on Tuesday, but
with that dread of anticipated pain which is a common condition of
sensibility and genius, he put him off with a note from "yours
unfaithfully, W.M.T." He went out on Wednesday for a little, and
came home at ten. He went to his room, suffering much, but
declining his man's offer to sit with him. He hated to make others
suffer. He was heard moving, as if in pain, about twelve, on the
eve of--</p>
<blockquote>"That happy morn<br>
Wherein the Son of Heaven's eternal King,<br>
Of wedded maid and virgin-mother born,<br>
Our great redemption from above did bring."</blockquote>
<p>Then all was quiet, and then he must have died--in a moment.
Next morning his man went in, and opening the windows found his
master dead, his arms behind his head, as if he had tried to take
one more breath. We think of him as of our Chalmers, found dead in
like manner: the same childlike, unspoiled, open face; the same
gentle mouth; the same spaciousness and softness of nature; the
same look of power. What a thing to think of,--his lying there
alone in the dark, in the midst of his own mighty London; his
mother and his daughters asleep, and, it may be, dreaming of his
goodness. God help them, and us all! What would become of us,
stumbling along this our path of life, if we could not, at our
utmost need, stay ourselves on Him?</p>
<p>Long years of sorrow, labor, and pain had killed him before his
time. It was found after death how little life he had to live. He
looked always fresh, with that abounding silvery hair, and his
young, almost infantine face, but he was worn to a shadow, and his
hands wasted as if by eighty years. With him it is the end of Ends;
finite is over and, infinite begun. What we all felt and feel can
never be so well expressed as in his own words of sorrow for the
early death of Charles Buller:--</p>

<h2>CHARLES FARRAR BROWNE (ARTEMUS WARD)</h2>
<h3>(1834-1867)</h3>
<center>BY CHARLES F. JOHNSON</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-c.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>harles Farrar Brown, better known to the public of thirty years
ago under his pen-name of Artemus Ward, was born in the little
village of Waterford, Maine, on the 26th day of April, 1834.
Waterford is a quiet village of about seven hundred inhabitants,
lying among the foot-hills of the White Mountains. When Browne was
a child it was a station on the western stage-route, and an
important depot for lumbermen's supplies. Since the extension of
railroads northerly and westerly from the seaboard, it has however
shared the fate of many New England villages in being left on one
side of the main currents of commercial activity, and gradually
assuming a character of repose and leisure, in many regards more
attractive than the life and bustle of earlier days. Many persons
are still living there who remember the humorist as a quaint and
tricksy boy, alternating between laughter and preternatural
gravity, and of a surprising ingenuity in devising odd practical
jokes in which good nature so far prevailed that even the victims
were too much amused to be very angry.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/browne_c.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Charles F. Browne</b></p>
<p>On both sides, he came from original New England stock; and
although he was proud of his descent from a very ancient English
family, in deference to whom he wrote his name with the final "e,"
he felt greater pride in his American ancestors, and always said
that they were genuine and primitive Yankees,--people of
intelligence, activity, and integrity in business, but entirely
unaffected by new-fangled ideas. It is interesting to notice that
Browne's humor was hereditary on the paternal side, his father
especially being noted for his quaint sayings and harmless
eccentricities. His cousin Daniel many years later bore a strong
resemblance to what Charles had been, and he too possessed a
kindred humorous faculty and told a story in much the same solemn
manner, bringing out the point as if it were something entirely
irrelevant and unimportant and casually remembered. The subject of
this sketch, however, was the only member of the family in whom a
love for the droll and incongruous was a controlling disposition.
As is frequently the case, a family trait was intensified in one
individual to the point where talent passes over into genius.</p>
<p>On his mother's side, too, Browne was a thorough-bred
New-Englander. His maternal grandfather, Mr. Calvin Farrar, was a
man of influence in town and State, and was able to send two of his
sons to Bowdoin College. I have mentioned Browne's parentage
because his humor is so essentially American. Whether this consists
in a peculiar gravity in the humorous attitude towards the subject,
rather than playfulness, or in a tendency to exaggerated statement,
or in a broad humanitarian standpoint, or in a certain flavor given
by a blending of all these, it is very difficult to decide.
Probably the peculiar standpoint is the distinguishing note, and
American humor is a product of democracy.</p>
<p>Humor is as difficult of definition as is poetry. It is an
intimate quality of the mind, which predisposes a man to look for
remote and unreal analogies and to present them gravely as if they
were valid. It sees that many of the objects valued by men are
illusions, and it expresses this conviction by assuming that other
manifest trifles are important. It is the deadly enemy of
sentimentality and affectation, for its vision is clear. Although
it turns everything topsy-turvy in sport, its world is not a chaos
nor a child's play-ground, for humor is based on keen perception of
truth. There is no method--except the highest poetic
treatment--which reveals so distinctly the falsehoods and
hypocrisies of the social and economic order as the <i>reductio ad
absurdum</i> of humor; for all human institutions have their
ridiculous sides, which astonish and amuse us when pointed out, but
from viewing which we suddenly become aware of relative values
before misunderstood. But just as poetry may degenerate into a
musical collection of words and painting into a decorative
association of colors, so humor may degenerate into the merely
comic or amusing. The laugh which true humor arouses is not far
removed from tears. Humor indeed is not always associated with
kindliness, for we have the sardonic humor of Carlyle and the
savage humor of Swift; but it is naturally dissociated from
egotism, and is never more attractive than when, as in the case of
Charles Lamb and Oliver Goldsmith, it is based on a loving and
generous interest in humanity.</p>
<p>Humor, must rest on a broad human foundation, and cannot be
narrowed to the notions of a certain class. But in most English
humor,--as indeed in all English literature except the very
highest,--the social class to which the writer does not belong is
regarded <i>ab extra</i>. In Punch, for instance, not only are
servants always given a conventional set of features, but they are
given conventional minds, and the jokes are based on a hypothetical
conception of personality. Dickens was a great humorist, and
understood the nature of the poor because he had been one of them;
but his gentlemen and ladies are lay figures. Thackeray's studies
of the flunky are capital; but he studies him <i>qua flunky</i>, as
a naturalist might study an animal, and hardly ranks him <i>sub
specie humanitatis</i>. But to the American humorist all men are
primarily men. The waiter and the prince are equally ridiculous to
him, because in each he finds similar incongruities between the man
and his surroundings; but in England there is a deep impassable
gulf between the man at the table and the man behind his chair.
This democratic independence of external and adventitious
circumstance sometimes gives a tone of irreverence to American
persiflage, and the temporary character of class distinctions in
America undoubtedly diminishes the amount of literary material "in
sight" but when, as in the case of Browne and Clemens, there is in
the humorist's mind a basis of reverence for things and persons
that are really reverend, it gives a breadth and freedom to the
humorous conception that is distinctively American.</p>
<p>We put Clemens and Browne in the same line, because in reading a
page of either we feel at once the American touch. Browne of course
is not to be compared to Clemens in affluence or in range in
depicting humorous character-types; but it must be remembered that
Clemens has lived thirty active years longer than his predecessor
did. Neither has written a line that he would wish to blot for its
foul suggestion, or because it ridiculed things that were lovely
and of good report. Both were educated in journalism, and came into
direct contact with the strenuous and realistic life of labor. And
to repeat, though one was born and bred west of the Mississippi and
the other far "down east," both are distinctly American. Had either
been born and passed his childhood outside our magic line, this
resemblance would not have existed. And yet we cannot say precisely
wherein this likeness lies, nor what caused it; so deep, so subtle,
so pervading is the influence of nationality. But their original
expressions of the American humorous tone are worth ten thousand
literary echoes of Sterne or Lamb or Dickens or Thackeray.</p>
<p>The education of young Browne was limited to the strictly
preparatory years. At the age of thirteen he was forced by the
death of his father to try to earn his living. When about fourteen,
he was apprenticed to a Mr. Rex, who published a paper at
Lancaster, New Hampshire. He remained there about a year, then
worked on various country papers, and finally passed three years in
the printing-house of Snow and Wilder, Boston. He then went to
Ohio, and after working for some months on the Tiffin Advertiser,
went to Toledo, where he remained till the fall of 1857. Thence he
went to Cleveland, Ohio, as local editor of the Plain Dealer. Here
appeared the humorous letters signed "Artemus Ward" and written in
the character of an itinerant showman. In 1860 he went to New York
as editor of the comic journal Vanity Fair.</p>
<p>His reputation grew steadily, and his first volume, 'Artemus
Ward, His Book,' was brought out in 1862. In 1863 he went to San
Francisco by way of the Isthmus and returned overland. This journey
was chronicled in a short volume, 'Artemus Ward, His Travels.' He
had already undertaken a career of lecturing, and his comic
entertainments, given in a style peculiarly his own, became very
popular. The mimetic gift is frequently found in the humorist; and
Browne's peculiar drawl, his profound gravity and dreamy, far-away
expression, the unexpected character of his jokes and the surprise
with which he seemed to regard the audience, made a combination of
a delightfully quaint absurdity. Browne himself was a very winning
personality, and never failed to put his audience in good humor.
None who knew him twenty-nine years ago think of him without
tenderness. In 1866 he visited England, and became almost as
popular there as lecturer and writer for Punch. He died from a
pulmonary trouble in Southampton, March 6th, 1867, being not quite
thirty-three years old. He was never married.</p>
<p>When we remember that a large part of Browne's mature life was
taken up in learning the printer's trade, in which he became a
master, we must decide that he had only entered on his career as
humorous writer. Much of what he wrote is simply amusing, with
little depth or power of suggestion; it is comic, not humorous. He
was gaining the ear of the public and training his powers of
expression. What he has left consists of a few collections of
sketches written for a daily paper. But the subjoined extracts will
show, albeit dimly, that he was more than a joker, as under the cap
and bells of the fool in Lear we catch a glimpse of the face of a
tender-hearted and philosophic friend. Browne's nature was so
kindly and sympathetic, so pure and manly, that after he had
achieved a reputation and was relieved from immediate pecuniary
pressure, he would have felt an ambition to do some worthy work and
take time to bring out the best that was in him. As it is, he had
only tried his 'prentice hand. Still, the figure of the old
showman, though not very solidly painted, is admirably done. He is
a sort of sublimated and unoffensive Barnum; perfectly consistent,
permeated with his professional view of life, yet quite incapable
of anything underhand or mean; radically loyal to the Union,
appreciative of the nature of his animals, steady in his humorous
attitude toward life: and above all, not a composite of shreds and
patches, but a personality. Slight as he is, and unconscious and
unpracticed as is the art that went to his creation, he is one of
the humorous figures of all literature; and old Sir John Falstaff,
Sir Roger de Coverley, Uncle Toby, and Dr. Primrose will not
disdain to admit him into their company; for he too is a man, not
an abstraction, and need not be ashamed of his parentage nor
doubtful of his standing among the "children of the men of
wit."</p>

<h3>EDWIN FORREST AS OTHELLO</h3>
<br>
<p>Durin a recent visit to New York the undersined went to see
Edwin Forrest. As I am into the moral show biziness myself I
ginrally go to Barnum's moral museum, where only moral peeple air
admitted, partickly on Wednesday arternoons. But this time I thot
I'd go and see Ed. Ed has bin actin out on the stage for many
years. There is varis 'pinions about his actin, Englishmen ginrally
bleevin that he's far superior to Mister Macready; but on one pint
all agree, &amp; that is that Ed draws like a six-ox team. Ed was
actin at Niblo's Garding, which looks considerable more like a
parster than a garding, but let that pars. I sot down in the pit,
took out my spectacles and commenced peroosin the evenin's bill.
The awjince was all-fired large &amp; the boxes was full of the
elitty of New York. Several opery glasses was leveled at me by
Gotham's fairest darters, but I didn't let on as tho I noticed it,
tho mebby I did take out my sixteen-dollar silver watch &amp;
brandish it round more than was necessary. But the best of us has
our weaknesses &amp; if a man has gewelry let him show it. As I was
peroosin the bill a grave young man who sot near me axed me if I'd
ever seen Forrest dance the Essence of Old Virginny. "He's immense
in that," sed the young man. "He also does a fair champion jig,"
the young man continnered, "but his Big Thing is the Essence of Old
Virginny." Sez I, "Fair youth, do you know what I'd do with you if
you was my sun?"</p>
<p>"No," sez he.</p>
<p>"Wall," sez I, "I'd appint your funeral to-morrow arternoon,
&amp; the <i>korps should be ready</i>. You're too smart to live on
this yerth."</p>
<p>He didn't try any more of his capers on me. But another
pussylanermuss individooul in a red vest and patent leather boots
told me his name was Bill Astor &amp; axed me to lend him 50 cents
till early in the mornin. I told him I'd probly send it round to
him before he retired to his virtoous couch, but if I didn't he
might look for it next fall as soon as I'd cut my corn. The
orchestry was now fiddling with all their might &amp; as the peeple
didn't understan anything about it they applaudid versifrusly.
Presently old Ed cum out. The play was Otheller or More of Veniss.
Otheller was writ by Wm. Shakspeer. The seene is laid in Veniss.
Otheller was a likely man &amp; was a ginral in the Veniss army. He
eloped with Desdemony, a darter of the Hon. Mr. Brabantio, who
represented one of the back districks in the Veneshun legislater.
Old Brabantio was as mad as thunder at this &amp; tore round
considerable, but finally cooled down, tellin Otheller, howsoever,
that Desdemony had come it over her par, &amp; that he had better
look out or she'd come it over him likewise. Mr. and Mrs. Otheller
git along very comfortable-like for a spell. She is sweet-tempered
and lovin--a nice, sensible female, never goin in for he-female
conventions, green cotton umbrellers, and pickled beats. Otheller
is a good provider and thinks all the world of his wife. She has a
lazy time of it, the hird girl doin all the cookin and washin.
Desdemony in fact don't have to git the water to wash her own hands
with. But a low cuss named Iago, who I bleeve wants to git Otheller
out of his snug government birth, now goes to work &amp; upsets the
Otheller family in most outrajus stile. Iago falls in with a
brainless youth named Roderigo &amp; wins all his money at poker.
(Iago allers played foul.) He thus got money enuff to carry out his
onprincipled skeem. Mike Cassio, a Irishman, is selected as a tool
by Iago. Mike was a clever feller &amp; a orficer in Otheller's
army. He liked his tods too well, howsoever, &amp; they floored him
as they have many other promisin young men. Iago injuces Mike to
drink with him, Iago slily throwin his whiskey over his shoulder.
Mike gits as drunk as a biled owl &amp; allows that he can lick a
yard full of the Veneshun fancy before breakfast, without sweatin a
hair. He meets Roderigo &amp; proceeds for to smash him. A feller
named Mentano undertakes to slap Cassio, when that infatooated
person runs his sword into him. That miserble man, Iago, pretends
to be very sorry to see Mike conduck hisself in this way &amp;
undertakes to smooth the thing over to Otheller, who rushes in with
a drawn sword &amp; wants to know what's up. Iago cunningly tells
his story &amp; Otheller tells Mike that he thinks a good deal of
him but that he cant train no more in his regiment. Desdemony
sympathises with poor Mike &amp; interceds for him with Otheller.
Iago makes him bleeve she does this because she thinks more of Mike
than she does of hisself. Otheller swallers Iagos lyin tail &amp;
goes to makin a noosence of hisself ginrally. He worries poor
Desdemony terrible by his vile insinuations &amp; finally smothers
her to deth with a piller. Mrs. Iago comes in just as Otheller has
finished the fowl deed &amp; givs him fits right &amp; left, showin
him that he has been orfully gulled by her miserble cuss of a
husband. Iago cums in &amp; his wife commences rakin him down also,
when he stabs her. Otheller jaws him a spell &amp; then cuts a
small hole in his stummick with his sword. Iago pints to
Desdemony's deth bed &amp; goes orf with a sardonic smile onto his
countenance. Otheller tells the peple that he has dun the state
some service &amp; they know it; axes them to do as fair a thing as
they can for him under the circumstances, &amp; kills hisself with
a fish-knife, which is the most sensible thing he can do. This is a
breef skedule of the synopsis of the play.</p>
<p>Edwin Forrest is a grate acter. I thot I saw Otheller before me
all the time he was actin &amp;, when the curtin fell, I found my
spectacles was still mistened with salt-water, which had run from
my eyes while poor Desdemony was dyin. Betsy Jane--Betsy Jane! let
us pray that our domestic bliss may never be busted up by a
Iago!</p>
<p>Edwin Forrest makes money actin out on the stage. He gits five
hundred dollars a nite &amp; his board &amp; washin. I wish I had
such a Forrest in my Garding!</p>

<h3>HIGH-HANDED OUTRAGE AT UTICA</h3>
<br>
<p>In the fall of 1856 I showed my show in Utiky, a trooly grate
sitty in the State of New York.</p>
<p>The people gave me a cordyal recepshun. The press was loud in
her prases.</p>
<p>1 day as I was givin a descripshun of my Beests and Snaiks in my
usual flowry stile, what was my skorn &amp; disgust to see a big
burly feller walk up to the cage containin my wax figgers of the
Lord's Last Supper, and cease Judas Iscariot by the feet and drag
him out on the ground. He then commenced fur to pound him as hard
as he cood.</p>
<p>"What under the son are you abowt?" cried I.</p>
<p>Sez he, "What did you bring this pussylanermus cuss here fur?"
&amp; he hit the wax figger another tremenjus blow on the hed.</p>
<p>Sez I, "You egrejus ass that air's a wax figger--a
representashun of the false 'Postle."</p>
<p>Sez he, "That's all very well fur you to say, but I tell you,
old man, that Judas Iscariot can't show hisself in Utiky with
impunerty by a darn site!" with which observashun he kaved in
Judassis hed. The young man belonged to 1 of the first famerlies in
Utiky. I sood him and the Joory brawt in a verdick of Arson in the
3d degree.</p>

<h3>AFFAIRS ROUND THE VILLAGE GREEN</h3>
<br>
<p>And where are the friends of my youth? I have found one of 'em,
certainly. I saw him ride in a circus the other day on a bareback
horse, and even now his name stares at me from yonder board-fence
in green and blue and red and yellow letters. Dashington, the youth
with whom I used to read the able orations of Cicero, and who as a
declaimer on exhibition days used to wipe the rest of us boys
pretty handsomely out--well, Dashington is identified with the
halibut and cod interests --drives a fish-cart, in fact, from a
certain town on the coast back into the interior. Hurburtson--the
utterly stupid boy--the lunkhead who never had his lesson, he's
about the ablest lawyer a sister State can boast. Mills is a
newspaper man, and is just now editing a Major General down South.
Singlingson, the sweet-faced boy whose face was always washed and
who was never rude, <i>he</i> is in the penitentiary for putting
his uncle's autograph to a financial document. Hawkins, the
clergyman's son, is an actor; and Williamson, the good little boy
who divided his bread and butter with the beggar-man, is a failing
merchant, and makes money by it. Tom Slink, who used to smoke Short
Sixes and get acquainted with the little circus boys, is popularly
supposed to be the proprietor of a cheap gaming establishment in
Boston, where the beautiful but uncertain prop is nightly tossed.
Be sure the Army is represented by many of the friends of my youth,
the most of whom have given a good account of themselves.</p>
<p>But Chalmerson hasn't done much. No, Chalmerson is rather of a
failure. He plays on the guitar and sings love-songs. Not that he
is a bad man--a kinder-hearted creature never lived, and they say
he hasn't yet got over crying for his little curly-haired sister
who died ever so long ago. But he knows nothing about business,
politics, the world, and those things. He is dull at trade--indeed,
it is the common remark that "Everybody cheats Chalmerson." He came
to the party the other evening and brought his guitar. They
wouldn't have him for a tenor in the opera, certainly, for he is
shaky in his upper notes; but if his simple melodies didn't gush
straight from the heart! why, even my trained eyes were wet! And
although some of the girls giggled, and some of the men seemed to
pity him, I could not help fancying that poor Chalmerson was nearer
heaven than any of us all.</p>

<h3>MR. PEPPER</h3>
<center>From 'Artemus Ward: His Travels'</center>
<br>
<p>My arrival at Virginia City was signalized by the following
incident:--</p>
<p>I had no sooner achieved my room in the garret of the
International Hotel than I was called upon by an intoxicated man,
who said he was an Editor. Knowing how rare it is for an Editor to
be under the blighting influence of either spirituous or malt
liquors, I received this statement doubtfully. But I said:</p>
<p>"What name?"</p>
<p>"Wait!" he said, and went out.</p>
<p>I heard him pacing unsteadily up and down the hall outside.</p>
<p>In ten minutes he returned, and said, "Pepper!"</p>
<p>Pepper was indeed his name. He had been out to see if he could
remember it, and he was so flushed with his success that he
repeated it joyously several times, and then, with a short laugh,
he went away.</p>
<p>I had often heard of a man being "so drunk that he didn't know
what town he lived in," but here was a man so hideously inebriated
that he didn't know what his name was.</p>
<p>I saw him no more, but I heard from him. For he published a
notice of my lecture, in which he said that I had <i>a dissipated
air!</i></p>

<h3>HORACE GREELEY'S RIDE TO PLACERVILLE</h3>
<center>From 'Artemus Ward: His Travels'</center>
<br>
<p>When Mr. Greeley was in California, ovations awaited him at
every town. He had written powerful leaders in the Tribune in favor
of the Pacific Railroad, which had greatly endeared him to the
citizens of the Golden State. And therefore they made much of him
when he went to see them.</p>
<p>At one town the enthusiastic populace tore his celebrated white
coat to pieces and carried the pieces home to remember him by.</p>
<p>The citizens of Placerville prepared to f&ecirc;te the great
journalist, and an extra coach with extra relays of horses was
chartered of the California Stage Company to carry him from Folsom
to Placerville--distance, forty miles. The extra was in some way
delayed, and did not leave Folsom until late in the afternoon. Mr.
Greeley was to be f&ecirc;ted at seven o'clock that evening by the
citizens of Placerville, and it was altogether necessary that he
should be there by that time. So the Stage Company said to Henry
Monk, the driver of the extra, "Henry, this great man must be there
by seven to-night." And Henry answered, "The great man shall be
there."</p>
<p>The roads were in an awful state, and during the first few miles
out of Folsom slow progress was made.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Greeley, "are you aware that I must be in
Placerville at seven o'clock to-night?"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" laconically replied Henry Monk.</p>
<p>Still the coach dragged slowly forward.</p>
<p>"Sir," said Mr. Greeley, "this is not a trifling matter. I
<i>must</i> be there at seven!"</p>
<p>Again came the answer, "I've got my orders!"</p>
<p>But the speed was not increased, and Mr. Greeley chafed away
another half-hour; when, as he was again about to remonstrate with
the driver, the horses suddenly started into a furious run, and all
sorts of encouraging yells filled the air from the throat of Henry
Monk.</p>
<p>"That is right, my good fellow," said Mr. Greeley. "I'll give
you ten dollars when we get to Placerville. Now we are going!"</p>
<p>They were indeed, and at a terrible speed.</p>
<p>Crack, crack! went the whip, and again "that voice" split the
air, "Get up! Hi-yi! G'long! Yip-yip."</p>
<p>And on they tore over stones and ruts, up hill and down, at a
rate of speed never before achieved by stage horses.</p>
<p>Mr. Greeley, who had been bouncing from one end of the stage to
the other like an India-rubber ball, managed to get his head out of
the window, when he said:--</p>
<p>"Do-on't-on't-on't you-u-u think we-e-e-e shall get there by
seven if we do-on't-on't go so fast?"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" That was all Henry Monk said. And on tore
the coach.</p>
<p>It was becoming serious. Already the journalist was extremely
sore from the terrible jolting--and again his head "might have been
seen from the window."</p>
<p>"Sir," he said, "I don't care-care-air if we <i>don't</i> get
there at seven."</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" Fresh horses--forward again, faster than
before--over rocks and stumps, on one of which the coach narrowly
escaped turning a summerset.</p>
<p>"See here!" shrieked Mr. Greeley, "I don't care if we don't get
there at all."</p>
<p>"I've got my orders! I work fer the California Stage Company, I
do. That's wot I <i>work</i> fer. They said, 'Get this man through
by seving.' An' this man's goin' through, you bet! Gerlong!
Whoo-ep!"</p>
<p>Another frightful jolt, and Mr. Greeley's bald head suddenly
found its way through the roof of the coach, amidst the crash of
small timbers and the ripping of strong canvas.</p>
<p>"Stop, you--maniac!" he roared.</p>
<p>Again answered Henry Monk:--</p>
<p>"I've got my orders! <i>Keep your seat, Horace!</i>"</p>
<p>At Mud Springs, a village a few miles from Placerville, they met
a large delegation of the citizens of Placerville, who had come out
to meet the celebrated editor, and escort him into town. There was
a military company, a brass band, and a six-horse wagon-load of
beautiful damsels in milk-white dresses, representing all the
States in the Union. It was nearly dark now, but the delegation was
amply provided with torches, and bonfires blazed all along the road
to Placerville.</p>
<p>The citizens met the coach in the outskirts of Mud Springs, and
Mr. Monk reined in his foam-covered steeds.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Greeley on board?" asked the chairman of the
committee.</p>
<p>"<i>He was, a few miles back</i>!" said Mr. Monk. "Yes," he
added, looking down through the hole which the fearful jolting had
made in the coach-roof, "Yes, I can see him! He is there!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Greeley," said the chairman of the committee, presenting
himself at the window of the coach, "Mr. Greeley, sir! We are come
to most cordially welcome you, sir!--Why, God bless me, sir, you
are bleeding at the nose!"</p>
<p>"I've got my orders!" cried Mr. Monk. "My orders is as follows:
Git him there by seving! It wants a quarter to seving. Stand out of
the way!"</p>
<p>"But, sir," exclaimed the committee-man, seizing the off-leader
by the reins, "Mr. Monk, we are come to escort him into town! Look
at the procession, sir, and the brass-band, and the people, and the
young women, sir!"</p>
<p>"<i>I've got my orders</i>!" screamed Mr. Monk. "My orders don't
say nothin' about no brass bands and young women. My orders says,
'Git him there by seving.' Let go them lines! Clear the way there!
Whoo-ep! Keep your seat, Horace!" and the coach dashed wildly
through the procession, upsetting a portion of the brass band, and
violently grazing the wagon which contained the beautiful young
women in white.</p>
<p>Years hence, gray-haired men who were little boys in this
procession will tell their grandchildren how this stage tore
through Mud Springs, and how Horace Greeley's bald head ever and
anon showed itself like a wild apparition above the coach-roof.</p>
<p>Mr. Monk was on time. There is a tradition that Mr. Greeley was
very indignant for a while: then he laughed and finally presented
Mr. Monk with a brand-new suit of clothes. Mr. Monk himself is
still in the employ of the California Stage Company, and is rather
fond of relating a story that has made him famous all over the
Pacific coast. But he says he yields to no man in his admiration
for Horace Greeley.</p>

<h2>SIR THOMAS BROWNE</h2>
<h3>(1605-1682)</h3>
<center>BY FRANCIS BACON</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-w.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>hen Sir Thomas Browne, in the last decade of his life, was asked
to furnish data for the writing of his memoirs in Wood's
'Athen&aelig; Oxonienses,' he gave in a letter to his friend Mr.
Aubrey in the fewest words his birthplace and the places of his
education, his admission as "Socius Honorarius of the College of
Physitians in London," the date of his being knighted, and the
titles of the four books or tracts which he had printed; and ended
with "Have some miscellaneous tracts which may be published."</p>
<p>This account of himself, curter than many an epitaph, and
scantier in details than the requirements of a census-taker's
blank, may serve, with many other signs that one finds scattered
among the pages of this author, to show his rare modesty and
effacement of his physical self. He seems, like some other
thoughtful and sensitive natures before and since, averse or at
least indifferent to being put on record as an eating, digesting,
sleeping, and clothes-wearing animal, of that species of which his
contemporary Sir Samuel Pepys stands as the classical instance, and
which the newspaper interviewer of our own day--that "fellow who
would vulgarize the Day of Judgment"--has trained to the most
noxious degree of offensiveness.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/browne_t.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Sir Thomas Browne</b></p>
<p>Sir Thomas felt, undoubtedly, that having admitted that select
company--"fit audience though few"--who are students of the
'Religio Medici' to a close intimacy with his highest mental
processes and conditions, his "separable accidents," affairs of
assimilation and secretion as one may say, were business between
himself and his grocer and tailor, his cook and his laundress.</p>
<p>The industrious research of Mr. Simon Wilkin, who in 1836
produced the completest edition (William Pickering, London) of the
literary remains of Sir Thomas Browne, has gathered from all
sources--his own note-books, domestic and friendly correspondence,
allusions of contemporary writers and the works of subsequent
biographers--all that we are likely, this side of Paradise, to know
of this great scholar and admirable man.</p>
<p>The main facts of his life are as follows. He was born in the
Parish of St. Michael's Cheap, in London, on the 19th of October,
1605 (the year of the Gunpowder Plot). His father, as is
apologetically admitted by a granddaughter, Mrs. Littleton, "was a
tradesman, a mercer, though a gentleman of a good family in
Cheshire" (<i>generosa familia</i>, says Sir Thomas's own epitaph).
That he was the parent of his son's temperament, a devout man with
a leaning toward mysticism in religion, is shown by the charming
story Mrs. Littleton tells of him, exhibiting traits worthy of the
best ages of faith, and more to be expected in the father of a
medi&aelig;val saint than in a prosperous Cheapside mercer, whose
son was to be one of the most learned and philosophical physicians
of the age of Harvey and Sydenham:--"His father used to open his
breast when he was asleep and kiss it in prayers over him, as 'tis
said of Origen's father, that the Holy Ghost would take possession
there." Clearly, it was with reverent memory of this good man that
Sir Thomas, near the close of his own long life, wrote:--"Among thy
multiplied acknowledgments, lift up one hand unto heaven that thou
wert born of honest parents; that modesty, humility, patience, and
veracity lay in the same egg and came into the world with
thee."</p>
<p>This loving father, of whom one would fain know more, died in
the early childhood of his son Thomas. He left a handsome estate of
&pound;9,000, and a widow not wholly inconsolable with her third
portion and a not unduly deferred second marriage to a titled
gentleman, Sir Thomas Button,--a knight so scantily and at the same
time so variously described, as "a worthy person who had great
places," and "a bad member" of "mutinous and unworthy carriage,"
that one is content to leave him as a problematical character.</p>
<p>The boy Thomas Browne being left to the care of guardians, his
estate was despoiled, though to what extent does not appear; nor
can it be considered greatly deplorable, since it did not prevent
his early schooling at that ancient and noble foundation of
Winchester, nor in 1623 his entrance into Pembroke College, Oxford,
and in due course his graduation in 1626 as bachelor of arts. With
what special assistance or direction he began his studies in
medical science, cannot now be ascertained; but after taking his
degree of master of arts in 1629, he practiced physic for about two
years in some uncertain place in Oxfordshire. He then began a
course of travel, unusually extensive for that day. His stepfather
upon occasion of his official duties under the government "shewed
him all Ireland in some visitation of the forts and castles." It is
improbable that Ireland at that time long detained a traveler
essentially literary in his tastes. Browne betook himself to France
and Italy, where he appears to have spent about two years, residing
at Montpellier and Padua, then great centres of medical learning,
with students drawn from most parts of Christendom. Returning
homeward through Holland, he received the degree of doctor of
medicine from the University of Leyden in 1633, and settled in
practice at Halifax, England.</p>
<p>At this time--favored probably by the leisure which largely
attends the beginning of a medical career, but which is rarely so
laudably or productively employed,--he wrote the treatise 'Religio
Medici,' which more than any other of his works has established his
fame and won the affectionate admiration of thoughtful readers.
This production was not printed until seven years later, although
some unauthorized manuscript copies, more or less faulty, were in
circulation. When in 1642 "it arrived in a most depraved copy at
the press," Browne felt it necessary to vindicate himself by
publishing a correct edition, although, he protests, its original
"intention was not publick: and being a private exercise directed
to myself, what is delivered therein was rather a memorial unto me
than an example or rule unto any other."</p>
<p>In 1636 he removed to Norwich and permanently established
himself there in the practice of physic. There in 1641 he married
Dorothy Mileham, a lady of good family in Norfolk; thereby not only
improving his social connections, but securing a wife "of such
symmetrical proportion to her worthy husband both in the graces of
her body and mind, that they seemed to come together by a kind of
natural magnetism." Such at least was the view of an intimate
friend of more than forty years, Rev. John Whitefoot, in the
'Minutes' which, at the request of the widow, he drew up after Sir
Thomas's death, and which contain the most that is known of his
personal appearance and manners. Evidently the marriage was a happy
one for forty-one years, when the Lady Dorothy was left
<i>m&aelig;stissima conjux</i>, as her husband's stately epitaph,
rich with many an <i>issimus</i>, declares. Twelve children were
born of it; and though only four of them survived their parents,
such mortality in carefully tended and well-circumstanced families
was less remarkable than it would be now, when two centuries more
of progress in medical science have added security and length to
human life.</p>
<p>The good mother--had she not endeared herself to the modern
reader by the affectionate gentleness and the quaint glimpses of
domestic life that her family letters reveal--would be irresistible
by the ingeniously bad spelling in which she reveled, transgressing
even the wide limits then allowed to feminine heterography.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Dr. Browne's professional prosperity was
not impaired by the suspicion which early attached to him, and soon
deepened into conviction, that he was addicted to literary
pursuits. He was in high repute as a physician. His practice was
extensive, and he was diligent in it, as also in those works of
literature and scientific investigation which occupied all
"snatches of time," he says, "as medical vacations and the
fruitless importunity of uroscopy would permit." His large family
was liberally reared; his hospitality and his charities were
ample.</p>
<p>In 1646 he printed his second book, the largest and most operose
of all his productions: the 'Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Inquiries
into Vulgar and Common Errors' the work evidently of the
<i>hor&aelig; subseciv&aelig;</i> of many years. In 1658 he gave to
the public two smaller but important and most characteristic works,
'Hydriotaphia' and 'The Garden of Cyrus.' Beside these publications
he left many manuscripts which appeared posthumously; the most
important of them, for its size and general interest, being
'Christian Morals.'</p>
<p>When Sir Thomas's long life drew to its close, it was with all
the blessings "which should accompany old age." His domestic life
had been one of felicity. His eldest and only surviving son, Edward
Browne, had become a scholar after his father's own heart; and
though not inheriting his genius, was already renowned in London,
one of the physicians to the King, and in a way to become, as
afterward he did, President of the College of Physicians. All his
daughters who had attained womanhood had been well married. He
lived in the society of the honorable and learned, and had received
from the King the honor of knighthood<a name=
"FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1">[1]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1">[1]</a>
As for this business of the knighting, one hesitates fully to adopt
Dr. Johnson's remark that Charles II. "had skill to discover
excellence and virtue to reward it, at least with such honorary
distinctions as cost him nothing." A candid observer of the walk
and conversation of this illustrious monarch finds room for doubt
that he was an attentive reader or consistent admirer of the
'Religio Medici,' or 'Christian Morals'; and though his own
personal history might have contributed much to a complete
catalogue of Vulgar Errors, Browne's treatise so named did not
include divagations from common decency in its scope, and so may
have failed to impress the royal mind. The fact is that the King on
his visit to Norwich, looking about for somebody to knight,
intended, as usual on such occasions, to confer the title on the
mayor of the city; but this functionary,--some brewer or grocer
perhaps, of whom nothing else than this incident is
recorded,--declined the honor, whereupon the gap was stopped with
Dr. Browne.</blockquote>
<p>Mr. John Evelyn, carrying out a long and cherished plan of
seeing one whom he had known and admired by his writings, visited
him at Norwich in 1671. He found Sir Thomas among fit surroundings,
"his whole house and garden being a paradise and cabinet of
rarities, and that of the best collections, especially medails,
books, plants, and natural things<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_2">[2]</a>." Here we have the right background and
accessories for Whitefoot's portrait of the central figure:--</p>
<blockquote>"His complexion and hair ... answerable to his name,
his stature moderate, and habit of body neither fat nor lean but
[Greek: eusarkos;] ... never seen to be transported with mirth or
dejected with sadness; always cheerful, but rarely merry at any
sensible rate; seldom heard to break a jest, and when he did, ...
apt to blush at the levity of it: his gravity was natural without
affectation. His modesty ... visible in a natural habitual blush,
which was increased upon the least occasion, and oft discovered
without any observable cause.... So free from loquacity or much
talkativeness, that he was something difficult to be engaged in any
discourse; though when he was so, it was always singular and never
trite or vulgar."</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor2">[2]</a>
These two distinguished authors were of congenial tastes, and both
cultivated the same Latinistic literary diction. Their meeting must
have occasioned a copious effusion of those "long-tailed words in
osity and ation" which both had so readily at command or made to
order. It is regrettable that Evelyn never completed a work
entitled 'Elysium Brittannicum' which he planned, and to which
Browne contributed a chapter 'Of Coronary Plants.' It would have
taken rank with its author's 'Sylva' among English
classics.</blockquote>
<p>A man of character so lofty and self-contained might be expected
to leave a life so long, honorable, and beneficent with becoming
dignity. Sir Thomas's last sickness, a brief but very painful one,
was "endured with exemplary patience founded upon the Christian
philosophy," and "with a meek, rational, and religious courage,"
much to the edification of his friend Whitefoot. One may see even a
kind of felicity in his death, falling exactly on the completion of
his seventy-seventh year.</p>
<p>He was buried in the church of St. Peter Mancroft, where his
monument still claims regard as chief among the <i>memorabilia</i>
of that noble sanctuary<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3">[3]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3">[3]</a>
In the course of repairs, "in August, 1840, his coffin was broken
open by a pickaxe; the bones were found in good preservation, the
fine auburn hair had not lost its freshness." It is painful to
relate that the cranium was removed and placed in the pathological
museum of the Norwich Hospital, labeled as "the gift of" some
person (name not recalled), whose own cranium is probably an object
of interest solely to its present proprietor. "Who knows the fate
of his own bones? ... We insult not over their ashes," says Sir
Thomas. The curator of the museum feels that he has a clever joke
on the dead man, when with a grin he points to a label bearing
these words from the 'Hydriotaphia':--"To be knaved out of our
graves, to have our skulls made drinking-bowls, and our bones
turned into pipes to delight and sport our enemies, are tragical
abominations escaped in burning burials."</blockquote>
<p>At the first appearance of Browne's several publications, they
attracted that attention from the learned and thoughtful which they
have ever since retained. The 'Religio Medici' was soon translated
into several modern languages as well as into Latin, and became the
subject of curiously diverse criticism. The book received the
distinction of a place in the Roman 'Index Expurgatorius,' while
from various points of view its author was regarded as a Romanist,
an atheist, a deist, a pantheist, and as bearing the number 666
somewhere about him.</p>
<p>A worthy Quaker, a fellow-townsman, was so impressed by his tone
of quietistic mysticism that he felt sure the philosophic doctor
was guided by "the inward light," and wrote, sending a godly book,
and proposing to clinch his conversion in a personal interview.
Such are the perils that environ the man who not only repeats a
creed in sincerity, but ventures to do and to utter his own
thinking about it.</p>
<p>From Browne's own day to the present time his critics and
commentators have been numerous and distinguished; one of the most
renowned among them being Dr. Johnson, whose life of the author,
prefixed to an edition of the 'Christian Morals' in 1756, is a fine
specimen of that facile and effective hack-work of which Johnson
was master. In that characteristic way of his, half of patronage,
half of reproof, and wholly pedagogical, he summons his subject to
the bar of his dialectics, and according to his lights administers
justice. He admits that Browne has "great excellencies" and
"uncommon sentiments," and that his scholarship and science are
admirable, but strongly condemns his style: "It is vigorous, but
rugged; it is learned, but pedantic; it is deep, but obscure; it
strikes, but does not please; it commands, but does not allure; his
tropes are harsh and his combinations uncouth."</p>
<p>Behemoth prescribing rules of locomotion to the swan! By how
much would English letters have been the poorer if Browne had
learned his art of Johnson!</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such objurgations, some have supposed that the
style of Johnson, perhaps without conscious intent, was founded
upon that of Browne. A tone of oracular authority, an academic
Latinism sometimes disregarding the limitations of the unlearned
reader, an elaborate balancing of antitheses in the same
period,--these are qualities which the two writers have in common.
But the resemblance, such as it is, is skin-deep. Johnson is a
polemic by nature, and at his best cogent and triumphant in
argument. His thought is carefully kept level with the apprehension
of the ordinary reader, while arrayed in a verbal pomp simulating
the expression of something weighty and profound. Browne is
intuitive and ever averse to controversy, feeling, as he
exquisitely says, that "many have too rashly charged the troops of
error and remain as trophies unto the enemies of truth. A man may
be in as just possession of the truth as of a city, and yet be
forced to surrender." Calmly philosophic, he writes for kindred
minds, and his concepts satisfying his own intellect, he delivers
them with as little passion as an &AElig;olian harp answering the
wind, and lingers not for applause or explanation. His being</p>
<blockquote>"Those thoughts that wander through
eternity,"</blockquote>
<p>he means that we too shall "have a glimpse of incomprehensibles,
and thoughts of things which thoughts but tenderly touch."</p>
<p>How grandly he rounds his pregnant paragraphs with phrases which
for stately and compulsive rhythm, sonorous harmony, and sweetly
solemn cadences, are almost matchless in English prose, and lack
only the mechanism of metre to give them the highest rank as
verse.</p>
<p>"Man is a noble animal, splendid in ashes and pompous in the
grave, solemnizing nativities and deaths with equal lustre, nor
omitting ceremonies of bravery in the infancy of his nature;" "When
personations shall cease, and histrionism of happiness be over;
when reality shall rule, and all shall be as they shall be
forever:"--such passages as these, and the whole of the 'Fragment
on Mummies,' one can scarcely recite without falling into something
of that chant which the blank verse of Milton and Tennyson seems to
enforce.</p>
<p>That the 'Religio Medici' was the work of a gentleman before his
thirtieth year, not a recluse nor trained in a cloister, but active
in a calling which keeps closest touch with the passions and
frailties of humanity, seems to justify his assertion, "I have
shaken hands with delight [<i>sc.</i> by way of parting] in my warm
blood and canicular days." So uniformly lofty and dignified is its
tone, and so austere its morality, that the book might be taken for
the fruit of those later and sadder years that bring the
philosophic mind. Its frank confessions and calm analysis of motive
and action have been compared with Montaigne's: if Montaigne had
been graduated after a due education in Purgatory, or if his
pedigree had been remotely crossed with a St. Anthony and he had
lived to see the <i>fluctus decumanus</i> gathering in the tide of
Puritanism, the likeness would have been closer.</p>
<p>"The 'Religio Medici,'" says Coleridge, "is a fine portrait of a
handsome man in his best clothes." There is truth in the criticism,
and if there is no color of a sneer in it, it is entirely true. Who
does not feel, when following Browne into his study or his garden,
that here is a kind of cloistral retreat from the common places of
the outside world, that the handsome man is a true gentleman and a
noble friend, and that his best clothes are his every-day wear?</p>
<p>This aloofness of Browne's, which holds him apart "in the still
air of delightful studies," is no affectation; it is an innate
quality. He thinks his thoughts in his own way, and "the style is
the man" never more truly than with him. One of his family letters
mentions the execution of Charles I. as a "horrid murther," and
another speaks of Cromwell as a usurper; but nowhere in anything
intended for the public eye is there an indication that he lived in
the most tumultuous and heroic period of English history. Not a
word shows that Shakespeare was of the generation just preceding
his, nor that Milton and George Herbert and Henry Vaughan, numerous
as are the parallels in their thought and feeling and in his, were
his contemporaries. Constant and extensive as are his excursions
into ancient literature, it is rare for him to make any reference
to writers of his own time.</p>
<p>Yet with all his delight in antiquity and reverence for the
great names of former ages, he is keen in the quest for new
discoveries. His commonplace books abound in ingenious queries and
minute observations regarding physical facts, conceived in the very
spirit of our modern school:--"What is the use of dew-claws in
dogs?" He does not instantly answer, as a schoolboy in this
Darwinian day would, "To carry out an analogy;" but the mere asking
of the question sets him ahead of his age. See too his curious
inquiries into the left-footedness of parrots and left-handedness
of certain monkeys and squirrels. The epoch-making announcement of
his fellow-physician Harvey he quickly appreciates at its true
value: "his piece 'De Circul. Sang.,' which discovery I prefer to
that of Columbus." And here again a truly surprising suggestion of
the great results achieved a century and two centuries later by
Jenner and Pasteur--concerning canine madness, "whether it holdeth
not better at second than at first hand, so that if a dog bite a
horse, and that horse a man, the evil proves less considerable." He
is the first to observe and describe that curious product of the
decomposition of flesh known to modern chemists as adipocere.</p>
<p>He is full of eager anticipation of the future. "Join sense unto
reason," he cries, "and experiment unto speculation, and so give
life unto embryon truths and verities yet in their chaos.... What
libraries of new volumes after-times will behold, and in what a new
world of knowledge the eyes of our posterity may be happy, a few
ages may joyfully declare."</p>
<p>But acute and active as our author's perceptions were, they did
not prevent his sharing the then prevalent theory which assigned to
the devil, and to witches who were his ministers, an important part
in the economy of the world. This belief affords so easy a solution
of some problems otherwise puzzling, that this degenerate age may
look back with envy upon those who held it in serene and
comfortable possession.</p>
<p>It is to be regretted, however, that the eminent Lord Chief
Justice Hale in 1664, presiding at the trial for witchcraft of two
women, should have called Dr. Browne, apparently as <i>amicus
curi&aelig;</i>, to give his view of the fits which were supposed
to be the work of the witches. He was clearly of the opinion that
the Devil had even more to do with that case than he has with most
cases of hysteria; and consequently the witches, it must be said,
fared no better in Sir Matthew Hale's court than many of their kind
in various parts of Christendom about the same time. But it would
be unreasonable for us to hold the ghost of Sir Thomas deeply
culpable because, while he showed in most matters an exceptionally
enlightened liberality of opinion and practice, in this one
particular he declined to deny the scientific dictum of previous
ages and the popular belief of his own time.</p>
<p>The mental attitude of reverent belief in its symbolic value, in
which this devout philosopher contemplated the material world, is
that of many of those who have since helped most to build the
structure of Natural Science. The rapturous exclamation of
Linn&aelig;us, "My God, I think thy thoughts after thee!" comes
like an antiphonal response by "the man of flowers" to these
passages in the 'Religio Medici':--"This visible world is but a
picture of the invisible, wherein, as in a portrait, things are not
truly, but in equivocal shapes, and as they counterfeit some real
substance in that invisible fabric." "Things are really true as
they correspond unto God's conception; and have so much verity as
they hold of conformity unto that intellect, in whose idea they had
their first determinations."</p>

<h3>FROM THE 'RELIGIO MEDICI'</h3>
<br>
<p>I could never divide myself from any man upon the difference of
an opinion, or be angry with his judgment for not agreeing with me
in that from which within a few days I should dissent myself. I
have no genius to disputes in religion, and have often thought it
wisdom to decline them, especially upon a disadvantage, or when the
cause of truth might suffer in the weakness of my patronage. Where
we desire to be informed, 'tis good to contest with men above
ourselves; but to confirm and establish our opinions, 'tis best to
argue with judgments below our own, that the frequent spoils and
victories over their reasons may settle in ourselves an esteem and
confirmed opinion of our own. Every man is not a proper champion
for truth, nor fit to take up the gauntlet in the cause of verity:
many from the ignorance of these maxims, and an inconsiderate zeal
for truth, have too rashly charged the troops of error, and remain
as trophies unto the enemies of truth. A man may be in as just
possession of truth as of a city, and yet be forced to surrender;
'tis therefore far better to enjoy her with peace, than to hazard
her on a battle: if therefore there rise any doubts in my way, I do
forget them, or at least defer them, till my better settled
judgment and more manly reason be able to resolve them; for I
perceive every man's own reason is his best Oedipus, and will, upon
a reasonable truce, find a way to loose those bonds wherewith the
subtleties of error have enchained our more flexible and tender
judgments. In philosophy, where truth seems double-faced, there is
no man more paradoxical than myself: but in divinity I love to keep
the road; and though not in an implicit, yet an humble faith,
follow the great wheel of the Church, by which I move, not
reserving any proper poles or motion from the epicycle of my own
brain: by these means I leave no gap for heresy, schisms, or
errors.</p>
<p>As for those wingy mysteries in divinity, and airy subtleties in
religion, which have unhinged the brains of better heads, they
never stretched the <i>pia mater</i> of mine: methinks there be not
impossibilities enough in religion for an active faith; the deepest
mysteries ours contains have not only been illustrated, but
maintained, by syllogism and the rule of reason. I love to lose
myself in a mystery, to pursue my reason to an <i>O altitudo!</i>
'Tis my solitary recreation to pose my apprehension with those
involved enigmas and riddles of the Trinity, with Incarnation and
Resurrection. I can answer all the objections of Satan and my
rebellious reason with that odd resolution I learned of Tertullian,
"Certum est quia impossible est." I desire to exercise my faith in
the difficultest point; for to credit ordinary and visible objects
is not faith, but persuasion. Some believe the better for seeing
Christ's sepulchre; and when they have seen the Red Sea, doubt not
of the miracle. Now contrarily, I bless myself and am thankful that
I live not in the days of miracles, that I never saw Christ nor his
disciples; I would not have been one of those Israelites that
passed the Red Sea, nor one of Christ's patients on whom he wrought
his wonders: then had my faith been thrust upon me; nor should I
enjoy that greater blessing pronounced to all that believe and saw
not. 'Tis an easy and necessary belief, to credit what our eye and
sense hath examined: I believe he was dead and buried, and rose
again; and desire to see him in his glory, rather than to
contemplate him in his cenotaph or sepulchre. Nor is this much to
believe; as we have reason, we owe this faith unto history: they
only had the advantage of a bold and noble faith who lived before
his coming, who upon obscure prophecies and mystical types could
raise a belief and expect apparent impossibilities.</p>
<p>In my solitary and retired imagination,</p>
<blockquote>"Neque enim cum lectulus aut me<br>
Porticus excepit, desum mihi"--</blockquote>
<p>I remember I am not alone, and therefore forget not to
contemplate Him and his attributes who is ever with me, especially
those two mighty ones, His wisdom and eternity: with the one I
recreate, with the other I confound my understanding; for who can
speak of eternity without a solecism, or think thereof without an
ecstasy? Time we may comprehend: it is but five days older than
ourselves, and hath the same horoscope with the world; but to
retire so far back as to apprehend a beginning, to give such an
infinite start forward as to conceive an end in an essence that we
affirm hath neither the one nor the other, it puts my reason to St.
Paul's sanctuary: my philosophy dares not say the angels can do it;
God hath not made a creature that can comprehend him; it is a
privilege of his own nature: <i>I am that I am</i>, was his own
definition unto Moses; and it was a short one, to confound
mortality, that durst question God or ask him what he was. Indeed
he only is; all others have and shall be; but in eternity there is
no distinction of tenses; and therefore that terrible term
<i>predestination</i>, which hath troubled so many weak heads to
conceive, and the wisest to explain, is in respect to God no
prescious determination of our states to come, but a definitive
blast of his will already fulfilled, and at the instant that he
first decreed it; for to his eternity, which is indivisible and all
together, the last trump, is already sounded, the reprobates in the
flame and the blessed in Abraham's bosom. St. Peter speaks modestly
when he saith, a thousand years to God are but as one day; for to
speak like a philosopher, those continued instances of time which
flow into a thousand years make not to him one moment: what to us
is to come, to his eternity is present, his whole duration being
but one permanent point, without succession, parts, flux, or
division.</p>
<p>The world was made to be inhabited by beasts, but studied and
contemplated by man; 'tis the debt of our reason we owe unto God,
and the homage we pay for not being beasts; without this, the world
is still as though it had not been, or as it was before the sixth
day, when as yet there was not a creature that could conceive or
say there was a world. The wisdom of God receives small honor from
those vulgar heads that rudely stare about, and with a gross
rusticity admire his works: those highly magnify him whose
judicious inquiry into his acts, and deliberate research into his
creatures, return the duty of a devout and learned admiration.</p>
<p>"Natura nihil agit frustra," is the only indisputable axiom in
philosophy; there are no grotesques in nature; not anything framed
to fill up empty cantons and unnecessary spaces: in the most
imperfect creatures, and such as were not preserved in the ark,
but, having their seeds and principles in the womb of nature, are
everywhere where the power of the sun is--in these is the wisdom of
His hand discovered; out of this rank Solomon chose the object of
his admiration; indeed, what reason may not go to school to the
wisdom of bees, ants, and spiders? what wise hand teacheth them to
do what reason cannot teach us? Ruder heads stand amazed at those
prodigious pieces of nature--whales, elephants, dromedaries, and
camels; these, I confess, are the colossi and majestic pieces of
her hand: but in these narrow engines there is more curious
mathematics; and the civility of these little citizens more neatly
sets forth the wisdom of their Maker. Who admires not
Regio-Montanus his fly beyond his eagle, or wonders not more at the
operation of two souls in those little bodies, than but one in the
trunk of a cedar? I could never content my contemplation with those
general pieces of wonder, the flux and reflux of the sea, the
increase of the Nile, the conversion of the needle to the north;
and have studied to match and parallel those in the more obvious
and neglected pieces of nature, which without further travel I can
do in the cosmography of myself: we carry with us the wonders we
seek without us; there is all Africa and her prodigies in us; we
are that bold and adventurous piece of nature which he that studies
wisely learns in a compendium, what others labor at in a divided
piece and endless volume.</p>
<p>Thus there are two books from whence I collect my divinity:
besides that written one of God, another of his servant nature,
that universal and public manuscript that lies expansed unto the
eyes of all; those that never saw him in the one have discovered
him in the other. This was the Scripture and Theology of the
heathens: the natural motion of the sun made them more admire him
than its supernatural station did the children of Israel; the
ordinary effect of nature wrought more admiration in them than in
the other all his miracles: surely the heathens knew better how to
join and read these mystical letters than we Christians, who cast a
more careless eye on these common hieroglyphics and disdain to suck
divinity from the flowers of nature. Nor do I so forget God as to
adore the name of nature; which I define not, with the schools, to
be the principle of motion and rest, but that straight and regular
line, that settled and constant course the wisdom of God hath
ordained the actions of his creatures, according to their several
kinds. To make a revolution every day is the nature of the sun,
because of that necessary course which God hath ordained it, from
which it cannot swerve but by a faculty from that voice which first
did give it motion. Now this course of nature God seldom alters or
perverts, but, like an excellent artist, hath so contrived his work
that with the selfsame instrument, without a new creation, he may
effect his obscurest designs. Thus he sweeteneth the water with a
wood, preserveth the creatures in the ark, which the blast of his
mouth might have as easily created; for God is like a skillful
geometrician, who when more easily, and with one stroke of his
compass, he might describe or divide a right line, had yet rather
to do this in a circle or longer way, according to the constituted
and forelaid principles of his art: yet this rule of his he doth
sometimes pervert to acquaint the world with his prerogative, lest
the arrogancy of our reason should question his power and conclude
he could not. And thus I call the effects of nature the works of
God, whose hand and instrument she only is; and therefore to
ascribe his actions unto her is to devolve the honor of the
principal agent upon the instrument; which if with reason we may
do, then let our hammers rise up and boast they have built our
houses, and our pens receive the honor of our writing. I hold there
is a general beauty in the works of God, and therefore no deformity
in any kind of species whatsoever: I cannot tell by what logic we
call a toad, a bear, or an elephant ugly, they being created in
those outward shapes and figures which best express those actions
of their inward forms. And having passed that general visitation of
God, who saw that all that he had made was good, that is,
conformable to his will, which abhors deformity, and is the rule of
order and beauty: there is no deformity but in monstrosity, wherein
notwithstanding there is a kind of beauty, nature so ingeniously
contriving the irregular parts that they become sometimes more
remarkable than the principal fabric. To speak yet more narrowly,
there was never anything ugly or misshapen but the chaos; wherein,
notwithstanding, to speak strictly, there was no deformity, because
no form, nor was it yet impregnate by the voice of God; now nature
is not at variance with art, nor art with nature, they being both
servants of his providence: art is the perfection of nature: were
the world now as it was the sixth day, there were yet a chaos;
nature hath made one world, and art another. In brief, all things
are artificial; for nature is the art of God.</p>
<p>I have heard some with deep sighs lament the lost lines of
Cicero; others with as many groans deplore the combustion of the
library of Alexandria; for my own part, I think there be too many
in the world, and could with patience behold the urn and ashes of
the Vatican, could I, with a few others, recover the perished
leaves of Solomon. I would not omit a copy of Enoch's Pillars had
they many nearer authors than Josephus, or did not relish somewhat
of the fable. Some men have written more than others have spoken:
Pineda quotes more authors in one work than are necessary in a
whole world. Of those three great inventions in Germany, there are
two which are not without their incommodities. It is not a
melancholy <i>utinam</i> of my own, but the desires of better
heads, that there were a general synod; not to unite the
incompatible difference of religion, but for the benefit of
learning, to reduce it, as it lay at first, in a few and solid
authors; and to condemn to the fire those swarms and millions of
rhapsodies begotten only to distract and abuse the weaker judgments
of scholars, and to maintain the trade and mystery of
typographers.</p>
<p>Again, I believe that all that use sorceries, incantations, and
spells are not witches, or, as we term them, magicians. I conceive
there is a traditional magic not learned immediately from the
Devil, but at second hand from his scholars, who, having once the
secret betrayed, are able, and do empirically practice without his
advice, they both proceeding upon the principles of nature; where
actives aptly conjoined to disposed passives will under any master
produce their effects. Thus, I think at first a great part of
philosophy was witchcraft, which being afterward derived to one
another, proved but philosophy, and was indeed no more but the
honest effects of nature: what invented by us is philosophy,
learned from him is magic. We do surely owe the discovery of many
secrets to the discovery of good and bad angels. I could never pass
that sentence of Paracelsus without an asterisk or annotation:
"Ascendens astrum multa revelat qu&aelig;rentibus magnalia
natur&aelig;, i.e., opera Dei." I do think that many mysteries
ascribed to our own inventions have been the courteous revelations
of spirits,--for those noble essences in heaven bear a friendly
regard unto their fellow natures on earth; and therefore believe
that those many prodigies and ominous prognostics which forerun the
ruins of States, princes, and private persons are the charitable
premonitions of good angels, which more careless inquiries term but
the effects of chance and nature.</p>
<p>Now, besides these particular and divided spirits there may be
(for aught I know) an universal and common spirit to the whole
world. It was the opinion of Plato, and it is yet of the Hermetical
philosophers: if there be a common nature that unites and ties the
scattered and divided individuals into one species, why may there
not be one that unites them all? However, I am sure there is a
common spirit that plays within us, yet makes no part of us: and
that is the Spirit of God, the fire and scintillation of that noble
and mighty essence which is the life and radical heat of spirits
and those essences that know not the virtue of the sun; a fire
quite contrary to the fire of hell: this is that gentle heat that
brooded on the waters, and in six days hatched the world; this is
that irradiation that dispels the mists of hell, the clouds of
horror, fear, sorrow, despair; and preserves the region of the mind
in serenity: whosoever feels not the warm gale and gentle
ventilation of this spirit (though I feel his pulse) I dare not say
he lives; for truly without this, to me there is no heat under the
tropic; nor any light, though I dwelt in the body of the sun.</p>
<p>I believe that the whole frame of a beast doth perish, and is
left in the same state after death as before it was materialled
unto life: that the souls of men know neither contrary nor
corruption; that they subsist beyond the body, and outlive death by
the privilege of their proper natures, and without a miracle; that
the souls of the faithful, as they leave earth, take possession of
heaven: that those apparitions and ghosts of departed persons are
not the wandering souls of men, but the unquiet walks of devils,
prompting and suggesting us into mischief, blood, and villainy;
instilling and stealing into our hearts that the blessed spirits
are not at rest in their graves, but wander solicitous of the
affairs of the world: but that those phantasms appear often, and do
frequent cemeteries, charnel-houses, and churches, it is because
those are the dormitories of the dead, where the Devil, like an
insolent champion, beholds with pride the spoils and trophies of
his victory in Adam.</p>
<p>This is that dismal conquest we all deplore, that makes us so
often cry, "Adam, quid fecisti?" I thank God I have not those
strait ligaments, or narrow obligations to the world, as to dote on
life, or be convulsed and tremble at the name of death: not that I
am insensible of the dread and horror thereof; or by raking into
the bowels of the deceased, continual sight of anatomies,
skeletons, or cadaverous reliques, like vespilloes or grave-makers,
I am become stupid or have forgot the apprehension of mortality;
but that marshaling all the horrors, and contemplating the
extremities thereof, I find not anything therein able to daunt the
courage of a man, much less a well-resolved Christian; and
therefore am not angry at the error of our first parents, or
unwilling to bear a part of this common fate, and like the best of
them to die--that is, to cease to breathe, to take a farewell of
the elements, to be a kind of nothing for a moment, to be within
one instant of a spirit. When I take a full view and circle of
myself without this reasonable moderator and equal piece of
justice, Death, I do conceive myself the miserablest person extant:
were there not another life that I hope for, all the vanities of
this world should not entreat a moment's breath from me; could the
Devil work my belief to imagine I could never die, I would not
outlive that very thought. I have so abject a conceit of this
common way of existence, this retaining to the sun and elements, I
cannot think this to be a man, or to live according to the dignity
of humanity. In expectation of a better, I can with patience
embrace this life, yet in my best meditations do often defy death:
I honor any man that contemns it, nor can I highly love any that is
afraid of it: this makes me naturally love a soldier, and honor
those tattered and contemptible regiments that will die at the
command of a sergeant. For a pagan there may be some motives to be
in love with life; but for a Christian to be amazed at death, I see
not how he can escape this dilemma--that he is too sensible of this
life, or hopeless of the life to come.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>I am naturally bashful; nor hath conversation, age, or travel
been able to effront or enharden me: yet I have one part of modesty
which I have seldom discovered in another, that is (to speak truly)
I am not so much afraid of death, as ashamed thereof: 'tis the very
disgrace and ignominy of our natures that in a moment can so
disfigure us that our nearest friends, wife, and children, stand
afraid and start at us. The birds and beasts of the field, that
before in a natural fear obeyed us, forgetting all allegiance,
begin to prey upon us. This very conceit hath in a tempest disposed
and left me willing to be swallowed up in the abyss of waters,
wherein I had perished unseen, unpitied, without wondering eyes,
tears of pity, lectures of mortality, and none had said, "Quantum
mutatus ab illo!" Not that I am ashamed of the anatomy of my parts,
or can accuse nature for playing the bungler in any part of me, or
my own vicious life for contracting any shameful disease upon me,
whereby I might not call myself as wholesome a morsel for the worms
as any.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Men commonly set forth the torments of hell by fire and the
extremity of corporal afflictions, and describe hell in the same
method that Mahomet doth heaven. This indeed makes a noise, and
drums in popular ears: but if this be the terrible piece thereof,
it is not worthy to stand in diameter with heaven, whose happiness
consists in that part that is best able to comprehend it--that
immortal essence, that translated divinity and colony of God, the
soul. Surely, though we place hell under earth, the Devil's walk
and purlieu is about it; men speak too popularly who place it in
those flaming mountains which to grosser apprehensions represent
hell. The heart of man is the place the Devil dwells in: I feel
sometimes a hell within myself; Lucifer keeps his court in my
breast; Legion is revived in me. There are as many hells as
Anaxarchus conceited worlds: there was more than one hell in
Magdalen, when there were seven devils, for every devil is an hell
unto himself; he holds enough of torture in his own <i>ubi</i>, and
needs not the misery of circumference to afflict him; and thus a
distracted conscience here is a shadow or introduction unto hell
hereafter. Who can but pity the merciful intention of those hands
that do destroy themselves? the Devil, were it in his power, would
do the like; which being impossible, his miseries are endless, and
he suffers most in that attribute wherein he is impassible, his
immortality.</p>
<p>I thank God, and with joy I mention it, I was never afraid of
hell, nor never grew pale at the description of that place; I have
so fixed my contemplations on heaven, that I have almost forgot the
idea of hell, and am afraid rather to lose the joys of the one than
endure the misery of the other: to be deprived of them is a perfect
hell, and needs, methinks, no addition to complete our afflictions.
That terrible term hath never detained me from sin, nor do I owe
any good action to the name thereof. I fear God, yet am not afraid
of him; his mercies make me ashamed of my sins, before his
judgments afraid thereof; these are the forced and secondary method
of his wisdom, which he useth but as the last remedy, and upon
provocation: a course rather to deter the wicked than incite the
virtuous to his worship. I can hardly think there was ever any
scared into heaven; they go the fairest way to heaven that would
serve God without a hell; other mercenaries, that crouch unto him
in fear of hell, though they term themselves the servants, are
indeed but the slaves of the Almighty.</p>
<p>That which is the cause of my election I hold to be the cause of
my salvation, which was the mercy and <i>beneplacit</i> of God,
before I was, or the foundation of the world. "Before Abraham was,
I am," is the saying of Christ; yet is it true in some sense, if I
say it of myself; for I was not only before myself, but Adam--that
is, in the idea of God, and the decree of that synod held from all
eternity: and in this sense, I say, the world was before the
creation, and at an end before it had a beginning; and thus was I
dead before I was alive; though my grave be England, my dying place
was Paradise; and Eve miscarried of me before she conceived of
Cain.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Now for that other virtue of charity, without which faith is a
mere notion and of no existence, I have ever endeavored to nourish
the merciful disposition and humane inclination I borrowed from my
parents, and regulate it to the written and prescribed laws of
charity: and if I hold the true anatomy of myself, I am delineated
and naturally framed to such a piece of virtue; for I am of a
constitution so general that it consorts and sympathizeth with all
things: I have no antipathy, or rather idiosyncrasy, in diet,
humor, air, anything. I wonder not at the French for their dishes
of frogs, snails, and toadstools; nor at the Jews for locusts and
grasshoppers; but being amongst them, make them my common viands,
and I find they agree with my stomach as well as theirs. I could
digest a salad gathered in a churchyard as well as in a garden. I
cannot start at the presence of a serpent, scorpion, lizard, or
salamander: at the sight of a toad or viper I find in me no desire
to take up a stone to destroy them. I feel not in myself those
common antipathies that I can discover in others; those national
repugnances do not touch me, nor do I behold with prejudice the
French, Italian, Spaniard, or Dutch: but where I find their actions
in balance with my countrymen's, I honor, love, and embrace them in
the same degree. I was born in the eighth climate, but seem for to
be framed and constellated unto all: I am no plant that will not
prosper out of a garden; all places, all airs, make unto me one
country; I am in England, everywhere, and under any meridian; I
have been shipwrecked, yet am not enemy with the sea or winds; I
can study, play or sleep in a tempest. In brief, I am averse from
nothing: my conscience would give me the lie if I should absolutely
detest or hate any essence but the Devil; or so at least abhor
anything but that we might come to composition. If there be any
among those common objects of hatred I do contemn and laugh at, it
is that great enemy of reason, virtue, and religion--the multitude:
that numerous piece of monstrosity which, taken asunder, seem men
and the reasonable creatures of God, but confused together, make
but one great beast and a monstrosity more prodigious than Hydra:
it is no breach of charity to call these fools; it is the style all
holy writers have afforded them, set down by Solomon in canonical
Scripture, and a point of our faith to believe so. Neither in the
name of multitude do I only include the base and minor sort of
people: there is a rabble even amongst the gentry, a sort of
plebeian heads, whose fancy moves with the same wheel as these; men
in the same level with mechanics, though their fortunes do somewhat
gild their infirmities, and their purses compound for their
follies.</p>
<p>I must give no alms to satisfy the hunger of my brother, but to
fulfill and accomplish the will and command of my God: I draw not
my purse for his sake that demands it, but His that enjoined it; I
believe no man upon the rhetoric of his miseries, nor to content
mine own commiserating disposition; for this is still but moral
charity, and an act that oweth more to passion than reason. He that
relieves another upon the bare suggestion and bowels of pity doth
not this so much for his sake as for his own; for by compassion we
make others' misery our own, and so, by relieving them, we relieve
ourselves also. It is as erroneous a conceit to redress other men's
misfortunes upon the common considerations of merciful natures,
that it may be one day our own case; for this is a sinister and
politic kind of charity, whereby we seem to bespeak the pities of
men in the like occasions. And truly I have observed that those
professed eleemosynaries, though in a crowd or multitude, do yet
direct and place their petitions on a few and selected persons:
there is surely a physiognomy which those experienced and master
mendicants observe, whereby they instantly discover a merciful
aspect, and will single out a face wherein they spy the signatures
and marks of mercy. For there are mystically in our faces certain
characters which carry in them the motto of our souls, wherein he
that cannot read ABC may read our natures. I hold moreover that
there is a phytognomy, or physiognomy, not only of men, but of
plants and vegetables; and in every one of them some outward
figures which hang as signs or bushes of their inward forms. The
finger of God hath left an inscription upon all his works, not
graphical or composed of letters, but of their several forms,
constitutions, parts and operations, which, aptly joined together,
do make one word that doth express their natures. By these letters
God calls the stars by their names; and by this alphabet Adam
assigned to every creature a name peculiar to its nature. Now there
are, besides these characters in our faces, certain mystical
figures in our hands, which I dare not call mere dashes, strokes
<i>&agrave; la vol&eacute;e</i>, or at random, because delineated
by a pencil that never works in vain; and hereof I take more
particular notice, because I carry that in mine own hand which I
could never read of or discover in another. Aristotle, I confess,
in his acute and singular book of physiognomy, hath made no mention
of chiromancy; yet I believe the Egyptians, who were nearer
addicted to those abstruse and mystical sciences, had a knowledge
therein, to which those vagabond and counterfeit Egyptians did
after pretend, and perhaps retained a few corrupted principles
which sometimes might verify their prognostics.</p>
<p>It is the common wonder of all men, how, among so many millions
of faces, there should be none alike. Now, contrary, I wonder as
much how there should be any: he that shall consider how many
thousand several words have been carelessly and without study
composed out of twenty-four letters; withal, how many hundred lines
there are to be drawn in the fabric of one man, shall easily find
that this variety is necessary; and it will be very hard that they
shall so concur as to make one portrait like another. Let a painter
carelessly limn out a million of faces, and you shall find them all
different; yea, let him have his copy before him, yet after all his
art there will remain a sensible distinction; for the pattern or
example of everything is the perfectest in that kind, whereof we
still come short, though we transcend or go beyond it, because
herein it is wide, and agrees not in all points unto its copy. Nor
doth the similitude of creatures disparage the variety of nature,
nor any way confound the works of God. For even in things alike
there is diversity; and those that do seem to accord do manifestly
disagree. And thus is man like God; for in the same things that we
resemble him we are utterly different from him. There was never
anything so like another as in all points to concur; there will
ever some reserved difference slip in, to prevent the identity,
without which two several things would not be alike, but the same,
which is impossible.</p>
<p>Naturally amorous of all that is beautiful, I can look a whole
day with delight upon a handsome picture, though it be but of an
horse. It is my temper, and I like it the better, to affect all
harmony; and sure there is music even in the beauty, and the silent
note which Cupid strikes, far sweeter than the sound of an
instrument: for there is music wherever there is harmony, order,
or, proportion: and thus far we may maintain <i>the music of the
spheres</i>; for those well-ordered motions and regular paces,
though they give no sound unto the ear, yet to the understanding
they strike a note most full of harmony. Whatsoever is harmonically
composed, delights in harmony, which makes me much distrust the
symmetry of those heads which declaim against all church music. For
myself, not only from my obedience, but my particular genius, I do
embrace it: for even that vulgar and tavern music, which makes one
man merry, another mad, strikes in me a deep fit of devotion and a
profound contemplation of the First Composer; there is something in
it of divinity more than the ear discovers: it is an hieroglyphical
and shadowed lesson of the whole world and creatures of God; such a
melody to the ear as the whole world, well understood, would afford
the understanding. In brief, it is a sensible fit of that harmony
which intellectually sounds in the ears of God. It unties the
ligaments of my frame, takes me to pieces, dilates me out of
myself, and by degrees, methinks, resolves me into heaven. I will
not say, with Plato, the soul is an harmony, but harmonical, and
hath its nearest sympathy unto music; thus some, whose temper of
body agrees and humors the constitution of their souls, are born
poets, though indeed all are naturally inclined unto rhythm.</p>
<p>There is surely a nearer apprehension of anything that delights
us in our dreams than in our waked senses: without this, I were
unhappy; for my awaked judgment discontents me, ever whispering
unto me that I am from my friend; but my friendly dreams in the
night requite me, and make me think I am within his arms. I thank
God for my happy dreams, as I do for my good rest, for there is a
satisfaction in them unto reasonable desires, and such as can be
content with a fit of happiness; and surely it is not a melancholy
conceit to think we are all asleep in this world, and that the
conceits of this life are as mere dreams to those of the next; as
the phantasms of the night to the conceits of the day. There is an
equal delusion in both, and the one doth but seem to be the emblem
or picture of the other; we are somewhat more than ourselves in our
sleeps, and the slumber of the body seems to be but the waking of
the soul. It is the ligation of sense, but the liberty of reason;
and our waking conceptions do not match the fancies of our sleeps.
At my nativity my ascendant was the watery sign of Scorpius; I was
born in the planetary hour of Saturn, and I think I have a piece of
that leaden planet in me. I am no way facetious, nor disposed for
the mirth and galliardize of company; yet in one dream I can
compose a whole comedy, behold the action, and apprehend the jests,
and laugh myself awake at the conceits thereof. Were my memory as
faithful as my reason is then fruitful, I would never study but in
my dreams, and this time also would I choose for my devotions; but
our grosser memories have then so little hold of our abstracted
understandings that they forget the story, and can only relate to
our awaked souls a confused and broken tale of that that hath
passed. Aristotle, who hath written a singular tract of sleep, hath
not, methinks, thoroughly defined it; nor yet Galen, though he seem
to have corrected it: for those noctambuloes and night-walkers,
though in their sleep do yet enjoy the action of their senses; we
must therefore say that there is something in us that is not in the
jurisdiction of Morpheus; and that those abstracted and ecstatic
souls do walk about in their own corps, as spirits with the bodies
they assume, wherein they seem to hear, see, and feel, though
indeed the organs are destitute of sense, and their natures of
those faculties that should inform them. Thus it is observed that
men sometimes, upon the hour of their departure, do speak and
reason above themselves. For then the soul, beginning to be freed
from the ligaments of the body, begins to reason like herself, and
to discourse in a strain above mortality.</p>

<h3>FROM 'CHRISTIAN MORALS'</h3>
<br>
<p>When thou lookest upon the imperfections of others, allow one
eye for what is laudable in them, and the balance they have from
some excellency, which may render them considerable. While we look
with fear or hatred upon the teeth of the viper, we may behold his
eye with love. In venomous natures something may be amiable:
poisons afford anti-poisons: nothing is totally or altogether
uselessly bad. Notable virtues are sometimes dashed with notorious
vices, and in some vicious tempers have been found illustrious acts
of virtue, which makes such observable worth in some actions of
King Demetrius, Antonius, and Ahab, as are not to be found in the
same kind in Aristides, Numa, or David. Constancy, generosity,
clemency, and liberality have been highly conspicuous in some
persons not marked out in other concerns for example or imitation.
But since goodness is exemplary in all, if others have not our
virtues, let us not be wanting in theirs; nor, scorning them for
their vices whereof we are free, be condemned by their virtues
wherein we are deficient. There is dross, alloy, and embasement in
all human tempers; and he flieth without wings, who thinks to find
ophir or pure metal in any. For perfection is not, like light,
centred in any one body; but, like the dispersed seminalities of
vegetables at the creation, scattered through the whole mass of the
earth, no place producing all, and almost all some. So that 'tis
well if a perfect man can be made out of many men, and to the
perfect eye of God, even out of mankind. Time, which perfects some
things, imperfects also others. Could we intimately apprehend the
ideated man, and as he stood in the intellect of God upon the first
exertion by creation, we might more narrowly comprehend our present
degeneration, and how widely we are fallen from the pure exemplar
and idea of our nature: for after this corruptive elongation, from
a primitive and pure creation we are almost lost in degeneration;
and Adam hath not only fallen from his Creator, but we ourselves
from Adam, our Tycho and primary generator.</p>
<p>If generous honesty, valor, and plain dealing be the cognizance
of thy family or characteristic of thy country, hold fast such
inclinations sucked in with thy first breath, and which lay in the
cradle with thee. Fall not into transforming degenerations, which
under the old name create a new nation. Be not an alien in thine
own nation; bring not Orontes into Tiber; learn the virtues, not
the vices, of thy foreign neighbors, and make thy imitation by
discretion, not contagion. Feel something of thyself in the noble
acts of thy ancestors, and find in thine own genius that of thy
predecessors. Rest not under the expired merits of others; shine by
those of thine own. Flame not, like the central fire which
enlighteneth no eyes, which no man seeth, and most men think there
is no such thing to be seen. Add one ray unto the common lustre;
add not only to the number, but the note of thy generation; and
prove not a cloud, but an asterisk in thy region.</p>
<p>Since thou hast an alarum in thy breast, which tells thee thou
hast a living spirit in thee above two thousand times in an hour,
dull not away thy days in slothful supinity and the tediousness of
doing nothing. To strenuous minds there is an inquietude in
overquietness and no laboriousness in labor; and to tread a mile
after the slow pace of a snail, or the heavy measures of the lazy
of Brazilia, were a most tiring penance, and worse than a race of
some furlongs at the Olympics. The rapid courses of the heavenly
bodies are rather imitable by our thoughts than our corporeal
motions; yet the solemn motions of our lives amount unto a greater
measure than is commonly apprehended. Some few men have surrounded
the globe of the earth; yet many, in the set locomotions and
movements of their days, have measured the circuit of it, and
twenty thousand miles have been exceeded by them. Move
circumspectly, not meticulously, and rather carefully solicitous
than anxiously solicitudinous. Think not there is a lion in the
way, nor walk with leaden sandals in the paths of goodness; but in
all virtuous motions let prudence determine thy measures. Strive
not to run, like Hercules, a furlong in a breath: festination may
prove precipitation; deliberating delay may be wise cunctation, and
slowness no slothfulness.</p>
<p>Despise not the obliquities of younger ways, nor despair of
better things whereof there is yet no prospect. Who would imagine
that Diogenes, who in his younger days was a falsifier of money,
should, in the after course of his life, be so great a contemner of
metal? Some negroes, who believe the resurrection, think that they
shall rise white. Even in this life regeneration may imitate
resurrection; our black and vicious tinctures may wear off, and
goodness clothe us with candor. Good admonitions knock not always
in vain. There will be signal examples of God's mercy, and the
angels must not want their charitable rejoices for the conversion
of lost sinners. Figures of most angles do nearest approach unto
circles, which have no angles at all. Some may be near unto
goodness who are conceived far from it; and many things happen not
likely to ensue from any promises of antecedencies. Culpable
beginnings have found commendable conclusions, and infamous courses
pious retractations. Detestable sinners have proved exemplary
converts on earth, and may be glorious in the apartment of Mary
Magdalen in heaven. Men are not the same through all divisions of
their ages: time, experience, self-reflections, and God's mercies,
make in some well-tempered minds a kind of translation before
death, and men to differ from themselves as well as from other
persons. Hereof the old world afforded many examples to the infamy
of latter ages, wherein men too often live by the rule of their
inclinations; so that, without any astral prediction, the first day
gives the last: men are commonly as they were; or rather, as bad
dispositions run into worser habits, the evening doth not crown,
but sourly conclude, the day.</p>
<p>If the Almighty will not spare us according to his merciful
capitulation at Sodom; if his goodness please not to pass over a
great deal of bad for a small pittance of good, or to look upon us
in the lump, there is slender hope for mercy, or sound presumption
of fulfilling half his will, either in persons or nations: they who
excel in some virtues being so often defective in others; few men
driving at the extent and amplitude of goodness, but computing
themselves by their best parts, and others by their worst, are
content to rest in those virtues which others commonly want. Which
makes this speckled face of honesty in the world; and which was the
imperfection of the old philosophers and great pretenders unto
virtue; who, well declining the gaping vices of intemperance,
incontinency, violence, and oppression, were yet blindly peccant in
iniquities of closer faces; were envious, malicious, contemners,
scoffers, censurers, and stuffed with vizard vices, no less
depraving the ethereal particle and diviner portion of man. For
envy, malice, hatred, are the qualities of Satan, close and dark
like himself; and where such brands smoke, the soul cannot be
white. Vice may be had at all prices; expensive and costly
iniquities, which make the noise, cannot be every man's sins; but
the soul may be foully inquinated at a very low rate, and a man may
be cheaply vicious to the perdition of himself.</p>
<p>Having been long tossed in the ocean of the world, he will by
that time feel the in-draught of another, unto which this seems but
preparatory and without it of no high value. He will experimentally
find the emptiness of all things, and the nothing of what is past;
and wisely grounding upon true Christian expectations, finding so
much past, will wholly fix upon what is to come. He will long for
perpetuity, and live as though he made haste to be happy. The last
may prove the prime part of his life, and those his best days which
he lived nearest heaven.</p>
<p>Live happy in the Elysium of a virtuously composed mind, and let
intellectual contents exceed the delights wherein mere pleasurists
place their paradise. Bear not too slack reins upon pleasure, nor
let complexion or contagion betray thee unto the exorbitancy of
delight. Make pleasure thy recreation or intermissive relaxation,
not thy Diana, life, and profession. Voluptuousness is as
insatiable as covetousness. Tranquillity is better than jollity,
and to appease pain than to invent pleasure. Our hard entrance into
the world, our miserable going out of it, our sicknesses,
disturbances, and sad rencounters in it, do clamorously tell us we
came not into the world to run a race of delight, but to perform
the sober acts and serious purposes of man; which to omit were
foully to miscarry in the advantage of humanity, to play away an
uniterable life, and to have lived in vain. Forget not the capital
end, and frustrate not the opportunity of once living. Dream not of
any kind of metempsychosis or transanimation, but into thine own
body, and that after a long time; and then also unto wail or bliss,
according to thy first and fundamental life. Upon a curricle in
this world depends a long course of the next, and upon a narrow
scene here an endless expansion hereafter. In vain some think to
have an end of their beings with their lives. Things cannot get out
of their natures, or be, or not be, in despite of their
constitutions. Rational existences in heaven perish not at all, and
but partially on earth; that which is thus once, will in some way
be always; the first living human soul is still alive, and all Adam
hath found no period.</p>
<p>Since the stars of heaven do differ in glory; since it hath
pleased the Almighty hand to honor the north pole with lights above
the south; since there are some stars so bright that they can
hardly be looked upon, some so dim that they can scarcely be seen,
and vast numbers not to be seen at all even by artificial eyes;
read thou the earth in heaven and things below from above. Look
contentedly upon the scattered difference of things, and expect not
equality in lustre, dignity, or perfection, in regions or persons
below; where numerous numbers must be content to stand like
lacteous or nebulous stars, little taken notice of, or dim in their
generations. All which may be contentedly allowable in the affairs
and ends of this world, and in suspension unto what will be in the
order of things hereafter, and the new system of mankind which will
be in the world to come; when the last may be the first, and the
first the last; when Lazarus may sit above C&aelig;sar, and the
just, obscure on earth, shall shine like the sun in heaven; when
personations shall cease, and histrionism of happiness be over;
when reality shall rule, and all shall be as they shall be
forever.</p>

<h3>FROM 'HYDRIOTAPHIA, OR URN-BURIAL'</h3>
<br>
<p>In the Jewish Hypog&aelig;um and subterranean cell at Rome was
little observable beside the variety of lamps and frequent draughts
of the holy candlestick. In authentic draughts of Antony and
Jerome, we meet with thigh bones and death's-heads; but the
cemeterial cells of ancient Christians and martyrs were filled with
draughts of Scripture stories; not declining the flourishes of
cypress, palms, and olive, and the mystical figures of peacocks,
doves, and cocks; but literately affecting the portraits of Enoch,
Lazarus, Jonas, and the vision of Ezekiel, as hopeful draughts and
hinting imagery of the resurrection--which is the life of the grave
and sweetens our habitations in the land of moles and pismires.</p>
<p>The particulars of future beings must needs be dark unto ancient
theories, which Christian philosophy yet determines but in a cloud
of opinions. A dialogue between two infants in the womb concerning
the state of this world, might handsomely illustrate our ignorance
of the next, whereof methinks we yet discourse in Plato's den, and
are but embryon philosophers.</p>
<p>Pythagoras escapes, in the fabulous hell of Dante, among that
swarm of philosophers, wherein, whilst we meet with Plato and
Socrates, Cato is to be found in no lower place than Purgatory.
Among all the set, Epicurus is most considerable, whom men make
honest without an Elysium, who contemned life without encouragement
of immortality, and making nothing after death, yet made nothing of
the king of terrors.</p>
<p>Were the happiness of the next world as closely apprehended as
the felicities of this, it were a martyrdom to live; and unto such
as consider none hereafter, it must be more than death to die,
which makes us amazed at those audacities that durst be nothing and
return into their chaos again. Certainly, such spirits as could
contemn death, when they expected no better being after, would have
scorned to live had they known any. And therefore we applaud not
the judgments of Machiavel that Christianity makes men cowards, or
that with the confidence of but half dying, the despised virtues of
patience and humility have abased the spirits of men, which pagan
principles exalted; but rather regulated the wildness of
audacities, in the attempts, grounds, and eternal sequels of death,
wherein men of the boldest spirits are often prodigiously
temerarious. Nor can we extenuate the valor of ancient martyrs, who
contemned death in the uncomfortable scene of their lives, and in
their decrepit martyrdoms did probably lose not many months of
their days, or parted with life when it was scarce worth the
living; for (beside that long time past holds no consideration unto
a slender time to come) they had no small disadvantage from the
constitution of old age, which naturally makes men fearful, and
complexionally superannuated from the bold and courageous thoughts
of youth and fervent years. But the contempt of death from corporal
animosity promoteth not our felicity. They may sit in the orchestra
and noblest seats of heaven who have held up shaking hands in the
fire, and humanly contended for glory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Epicurus lies deep in Dante's hell, wherein we meet
with tombs inclosing souls which denied their immortalities. But
whether the virtuous heathen, who lived better than he spake, or,
erring in the principles of himself, yet lived above philosophers
of more specious maxims, lie so deep as he is placed; at least so
low as not to rise against Christians who, believing or knowing
that truth, have lastingly denied it in their practice and
conversation--were a query too sad to insist on.</p>
<p>But all or most apprehensions rested in opinions of some future
being, which, ignorantly or coldly believed, begat those perverted
conceptions, ceremonies, sayings, which Christians pity or laugh
at. Happy are they which live not in that disadvantage of time,
when men could say little for futurity but from reason; whereby the
noblest minds fell often upon doubtful deaths and melancholy
dissolutions. With those hopes Socrates warmed his doubtful spirits
against that cold potion; and Cato, before he durst give the fatal
stroke, spent part of the night in reading the immortality of
Plato, thereby confirming his wavering hand unto the animosity of
that attempt.</p>
<p>It is the heaviest stone that melancholy can throw at a man, to
tell him he is at the end of his nature; or that there is no
farther state to come, unto which this seems progressional, and
otherwise made in vain. Without this accomplishment, the natural
expectation and desire of such a state were but a fallacy in
nature. Unsatisfied considerators would quarrel at the justice of
their constitutions, and rest content that Adam had fallen lower;
whereby, by knowing no other original, and deeper ignorance of
themselves, they might have enjoyed the happiness of inferior
creatures, who in tranquillity possess their constitutions, as
having not the apprehension to deplore their own natures; and being
framed below the circumference of these hopes, or cognition of
better being, the wisdom of God hath necessitated their
contentment. But the superior ingredient and obscured part of
ourselves, whereto all present felicities afford no resting
contentment, will be able at last to tell us we are more than our
present selves, and evacuate such hopes in the fruition of their
own accomplishments....</p>
<p>But the iniquity of oblivion blindly scattereth her poppy, and
deals with the memory of men without distinction to merit of
perpetuity. Who can but pity the founder of the pyramids?
Erostratus lives that burnt the Temple of Diana; he is almost lost
that built it. Time hath spared the epitaph of Adrian's horse,
confounded that of himself. In vain we compute our felicities by
the advantage of our good names, since bad have equal durations;
and Thersites is like to live as long as Agamemnon. Who knows
whether the best of men be known, or whether there be not more
remarkable persons forgot than any that stand remembered in the
known account of time? Without the favor of the everlasting
register, the first man had been as unknown as the last, and
Methuselah's long life had been his only chronicle.</p>
<p>Oblivion is not to be hired. The greater part must be content to
be as though they had not been; to be found in the register of God,
not in the record of man. Twenty-seven names make up the first
story, and the recorded names ever since contain not one living
century. The number of the dead long exceedeth all that shall live.
The night of time far surpasseth the day; and who knows when was
the equinox? Every hour adds unto that current arithmetic, which
scarce stands one moment. And since death must be the Lucina of
life, and even pagans could doubt whether thus to live were to die;
since our longest sun sets at right declensions, and makes but
winter arches, and therefore it cannot be long before we lie down
in darkness, and have our light in ashes<a name=
"FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4">[4]</a>; since the brother of
death daily haunts us with dying mementos, and time, that grows old
itself, bids us hope no long duration, diuturnity is a dream and
folly of expectation.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor4">[4]</a>
According to the custom of the Jews, who placed a lighted wax
candle in a pot of ashes by the corpse.</blockquote>
<p>Darkness and light divide the course of time, and oblivion
shares with memory a great part even of our living beings. We
slightly remember our felicities, and the smartest strokes of
affliction leave but short smart upon us. Sense endureth no
extremities, and sorrows destroy us or themselves. To weep into
stones are fables. Afflictions induce callosities; miseries are
slippery, or fall like snow upon us, which notwithstanding is no
unhappy stupidity. To be ignorant of evils to come, and forgetful
of evils past, is a merciful provision in nature, whereby we digest
the mixture of our few and evil days, and our delivered senses not
relapsing into cutting remembrances, our sorrows are not kept raw
by the edge of repetitions. A great part of antiquity contented
their hopes of subsistency with a transmigration of their souls; a
good way to continue their memories, while, having the advantage of
plural successions, they could not but act something remarkable in
such variety of beings, and enjoying the fame of their passed
selves, making accumulation of glory unto their last durations.
Others, rather than be lost in the uncomfortable night of nothing,
were content to recede into the common being, and make one particle
of the public soul of all things, which was no more than to return
into their unknown and divine original again. Egyptian ingenuity
was more unsatisfied, contriving their bodies in sweet
consistencies to attend the return of their souls. But all was
vanity, feeding the wind and folly. The Egyptian mummies, which
Cambyses or time hath spared, avarice now consumeth. Mummy is
become merchandise, Mizraim cures wounds, and Pharaoh is sold for
balsams....</p>
<p>There is nothing strictly immortal but immortality. Whatever
hath no beginning may be confident of no end, which is the peculiar
of that necessary essence that cannot destroy itself, and the
highest strain of omnipotency to be so powerfully constituted, as
not to suffer even from the power of itself. All others have a
dependent being, and within the reach of destruction. But the
sufficiency of Christian immortality frustrates all earthly glory,
and the quality of either state after death makes a folly of
posthumous memory. God, who can only destroy our souls, and hath
assured our resurrection, either of our bodies or names hath
directly promised no duration. Wherein there is so much of chance,
that the boldest expectants have found unhappy frustration; and to
hold long subsistence seems but a scape in oblivion. But man is a
noble animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave,
solemnizing nativities and deaths with equal lustre, nor omitting
ceremonies of bravery in the infamy of his nature....</p>
<p>Life is a pure flame, and we live by an invisible sun within us.
A small fire sufficeth for life; great flames seemed too little
after death, while men vainly affected pyres, and to burn like
Sardanapalus. But the wisdom of funeral laws found the folly of
prodigal blazes, and reduced undoing fires into the rule of sober
obsequies, wherein few could be so mean as not to provide wood,
pitch, a mourner, and an urn....</p>
<p>While some have studied monuments, others have studiously
declined them; and some have been so vainly boisterous, that they
durst not acknowledge their graves; wherein Alaricus seems more
subtle, who had a river turned to hide his bones at the bottom.
Even Sylla, who thought himself safe in his urn, could not prevent
revenging tongues, and stones thrown at his monument. Happy are
they whom privacy makes innocent, who deal so with men in this
world that they are not afraid to meet them in the next; who when
they die make no commotion among the dead, and are not touched with
that poetical taunt of Isaiah.</p>
<p>Pyramids, arches, obelisks, were but the irregularities of
vainglory and wild enormities of ancient magnanimity. But the most
magnanimous resolution rests in the Christian religion, which
trampleth upon pride and sits on the neck of ambition, humbly
pursuing that infallible perpetuity unto which all others must
diminish their diameters, and be poorly seen in angles of
contingency.</p>
<p>Pious spirits, who passed their days in raptures of futurity,
made little more of this world than the world that was before it,
while they lay obscure in the chaos of preordination and night of
their forebeings. And if any have been so happy as truly to
understand Christian annihilation, ecstasis, exolution,
liquefaction, transformation, the kiss of the spouse, gustation of
God, and ingression into the divine shadow, they have already had a
handsome anticipation of heaven; the glory of the world is surely
over, and the earth in ashes unto them.</p>

<h3>FROM 'A FRAGMENT ON MUMMIES'</h3>
<br>
<p>Wise Egypt, prodigal of her embalmments, wrapped up her princes
and great commanders in aromatical folds, and, studiously
extracting from corruptible bodies their corruption, ambitiously
looked forward to immortality; from which vainglory we have become
acquainted with many remnants of the old world, who could discourse
unto us of the great things of yore, and tell us strange tales of
the sons of Mizraim and ancient braveries of Egypt. Wonderful
indeed are the preserves of time, which openeth unto us mummies
from crypts and pyramids, and mammoth bones from caverns and
excavations; whereof man hath found the best preservation,
appearing unto us in some sort fleshly, while beasts must be fain
of an osseous continuance.</p>
<p>In what original this practice of the Egyptians had root, divers
authors dispute; while some place the origin hereof in the desire
to prevent the separation of the soul by keeping the body
untabified, and alluring the spiritual part to remain by sweet and
precious odors. But all this was but fond inconsideration. The
soul, having broken its ..., is not stayed by bands and cerecloths,
nor to be recalled by Sabaean odors, but fleeth to the place of
invisibles, the <i>ubi</i> of spirits, and needeth a surer than
Hermes's seal to imprison it to its medicated trunk, which yet
subsists anomalously in its indestructible case, and, like a widow
looking for her husband, anxiously awaits its return....</p>
<p>That mummy is medicinal, the Arabian Doctor Haly delivereth, and
divers confirms; but of the particular uses thereof, there is much
discrepancy of opinion. While Hofmannus prescribes the same to
epileptics, Johan de Muralto commends the use thereof to gouty
persons; Bacon likewise extols it as a stiptic, and Junkenius
considers it of efficacy to resolve coagulated blood. Meanwhile, we
hardly applaud Francis the First of France, who always carried
mummies with him as a panacea against all disorders; and were the
efficacy thereof more clearly made out, scarce conceive the use
thereof allowable in physic, exceeding the barbarities of Cambyses,
and turning old heroes unto unworthy potions. Shall Egypt lend out
her ancients unto chirurgeons and apothecaries, and Cheops and
Psammitticus be weighed unto us for drugs? Shall we eat of Chamnes
and Amosis in electuaries and pills, and be cured by cannibal
mixtures? Surely, such diet is dismal vampirism, and exceeds in
horror the black banquet of Domitian, not to be paralleled except
in those Arabian feasts, wherein Ghoules feed horribly.</p>
<p>But the common opinion of the virtues of mummy bred great
consumption thereof, and princes and great men contended for this
strange panacea, wherein Jews dealt largely, manufacturing mummies
from dead carcasses and giving them the names of kings, while
specifics were compounded from crosses and gibbet leavings. There
wanted not a set of Arabians who counterfeited mummies so
accurately that it needed great skill to distinguish the false from
the true. Queasy stomachs would hardly fancy the doubtful potion,
wherein one might so easily swallow a cloud for his Juno, and
defraud the fowls of the air while in conceit enjoying the
conserves of Canopus....</p>
<p>For those dark caves and mummy repositories are Satan's abodes,
wherein he speculates and rejoices on human vainglory, and keeps
those kings and conquerors, whom alive he bewitched, whole for that
great day when he will claim his own, and marshal the kings of
Nilus and Thebes in sad procession unto the pit.</p>
<p>Death, that fatal necessity which so many would overlook or
blinkingly survey, the old Egyptians held continually before their
eyes. Their embalmed ancestors they carried about at their
banquets, as holding them still a part of their families, and not
thrusting them from their places at feasts. They wanted not
likewise a sad preacher at their tables to admonish them daily of
death,--surely an unnecessary discourse while they banqueted in
sepulchres. Whether this were not making too much of death, as
tending to assuefaction, some reason there is to doubt; but certain
it is that such practices would hardly be embraced by our modern
gourmands, who like not to look on faces of <i>mortua</i>, or be
elbowed by mummies.</p>
<p>Yet in those huge structures and pyramidal immensities, of the
builders whereof so little is known, they seemed not so much to
raise sepulchres or temples to death as to contemn and disdain it,
astonishing heaven with their audacities, and looking forward with
delight to their interment in those eternal piles. Of their living
habitations they made little account, conceiving of them but as
<i>hospitia</i>, or inns, while they adorned the sepulchres of the
dead, and, planting thereon lasting bases, defied the crumbling
touches of time and the misty vaporousness of oblivion. Yet all
were but Babel vanities. Time sadly overcometh all things, and is
now dominant, and sitteth upon a sphinx, and looketh unto Memphis
and old Thebes, while his sister Oblivion reclineth semisomnous on
a pyramid, gloriously triumphing, making puzzles of Titanian
erections, and turning old glories into dreams. History sinketh
beneath her cloud. The traveler, as he paceth amazedly through
those deserts, asketh of her, Who builded them? and she mumbleth
something, but what it is he heareth not.</p>
<p>Egypt itself is now become the land of obliviousness, and
doteth. Her ancient civility is gone, and her glory hath vanished
as a phantasma. Her youthful days are over, and her face hath
become wrinkled and tetric. She poreth not upon the heavens;
astronomy is dead unto her, and knowledge maketh other cycles.
Canopus is afar off, Memnon resoundeth not to the sun, and Nilus
heareth strange voices. Her monuments are but hieroglyphically
sempiternal. Osiris and Anubis, her averruncous deities, have
departed, while Orus yet remains dimly shadowing the principle of
vicissitude and the effluxion of things, but receiveth little
oblation.</p>

<h3>FROM 'A LETTER TO A FRIEND'</h3>
<br>
<p>He was willing to quit the world alone and altogether, leaving
no earnest behind him for corruption or after-grave, having small
content in that common satisfaction to survive or live in another,
but amply satisfied that his disease should die with himself, nor
revive in a posterity to puzzle physic, and make sad mementos of
their parent hereditary....</p>
<p>In this deliberate and creeping progress unto the grave, he was
somewhat too young and of too noble a mind to fall upon that stupid
symptom, observable in divers persons near their journey's end, and
which may be reckoned among the mortal symptoms of their last
disease; that is, to become more narrow-minded, miserable, and
tenacious, unready to part with anything when they are ready to
part with all, and afraid to want when they have no time to spend;
meanwhile physicians, who know that many are mad but in a single
depraved imagination, and one prevalent decipiency, and that beside
and out of such single deliriums a man may meet with sober actions
and good sense in Bedlam, cannot but smile to see the heirs and
concerned relations gratulating themselves on the sober departure
of their friends; and though they behold such mad covetous
passages, content to think they die in good understanding, and in
their sober senses.</p>
<p>Avarice, which is not only infidelity but idolatry, either from
covetous progeny or questuary education, had no root in his breast,
who made good works the expression of his faith, and was big with
desires unto public and lasting charities; and surely, where good
wishes and charitable intentions exceed abilities, theorical
beneficency may be more than a dream. They build not castles in the
air who would build churches on earth; and though they leave no
such structures here, may lay good foundations in heaven. In brief,
his life and death were such that I could not blame them who wished
the like, and almost to have been himself: almost, I say; for
though we may wish the prosperous appurtenances of others, or to be
another in his happy accidents, yet so intrinsical is every man
unto himself that some doubt may be made whether any would exchange
his being, or substantially become another man.</p>
<p>He had wisely seen the world at home and abroad, and thereby
observed under what variety men are deluded in the pursuit of that
which is not here to be found. And although he had no opinion of
reputed felicities below, and apprehended men widely out in the
estimate of such happiness, yet his sober contempt of the world
wrought no Democratism or Cynicism, no laughing or snarling at it,
as well understanding there are not felicities in this world to
satisfy a serious mind; and therefore, to soften the stream of our
lives, we are fain to take in the reputed contentions of this
world, to unite with the crowd in their beatitudes, and to make
ourselves happy by consortion, opinion, or co-existimation: for
strictly to separate from received and customary felicities, and to
confine unto the rigor of realities, were to contract the
consolation of our beings unto too uncomfortable
circumscriptions.</p>
<p>Not to be content with life is the unsatisfactory state of those
who destroy themselves; who, being afraid to live, run blindly upon
their own death, which no man fears by experience: and the Stoics
had a notable doctrine to take away the fear thereof; that is, in
such extremities, to desire that which is not to be avoided, and
wish what might be feared; and so made evils voluntary and to suit
with their own desires, which took off the terror of them.</p>
<p>But the ancient martyrs were not encouraged by such fallacies,
who, though they feared not death, were afraid to be their own
executioners; and therefore thought it more wisdom to crucify their
lusts than their bodies, to circumcise than stab their hearts, and
to mortify than kill themselves.</p>
<p>His willingness to leave this world about that age when most men
think they may best enjoy it, though paradoxical unto worldly ears,
was not strange unto mine, who have so often observed that many,
though old, oft stick fast unto the world, and seem to be drawn
like Cacus's oxen, backward with great struggling and reluctancy
unto the grave. The long habit of living makes mere men more hardly
to part with life, and all to be nothing, but what is to come. To
live at the rate of the old world, when some could scarce remember
themselves young, may afford no better digested death than a more
moderate period. Many would have thought it an happiness to have
had their lot of life in some notable conjunctures of ages past;
but the uncertainty of future times hath tempted few to make a part
in ages to come. And surely, he that hath taken the true altitude
of things, and rightly calculated the degenerate state of this age,
is not like to envy those that shall live in the next, much less
three or four hundred years hence, when no man can comfortably
imagine what face this world will carry; and therefore, since every
age makes a step unto the end of all things, and the Scripture
affords so hard a character of the last times, quiet minds will be
content with their generations, and rather bless ages past than be
ambitious of those to come.</p>
<p>Though age had set no seal upon his face, yet a dim eye might
clearly discover fifty in his actions; and therefore, since wisdom
is the gray hair, and an unspotted life old age, although his years
came short, he might have been said to have held up with longer
livers, and to have been Solomon's old man. And surely if we deduct
all those days of our life which we might wish unlived, and which
abate the comfort of those we now live, if we reckon up only those
days which God hath accepted of our lives, a life of good years
will hardly be a span long; the son in this sense may outlive the
father, and none be climacterically old. He that early arriveth
unto the parts and prudence of age is happily old without the
uncomfortable attendants of it; and 'tis superfluous to live unto
gray hairs, when in a precocious temper we anticipate the virtues
of them. In brief, he cannot be accounted young who outliveth the
old man. He that hath early arrived unto the measure of a perfect
stature in Christ, hath already fulfilled the prime and longest
intention of his being; and one day lived after the perfect rule of
piety is to be preferred before sinning immortality.</p>
<p>Although he attained not unto the years of his predecessors, yet
he wanted not those preserving virtues which confirm the thread of
weaker constitutions. <i>Cautelous</i> chastity and <i>crafty</i>
sobriety were far from him; those jewels were <i>paragon</i>,
without flaw, hair, ice, or cloud in him: which affords me a hint
to proceed in these good wishes and few mementos unto you.</p>

<h3>SOME RELATIONS WHOSE TRUTH WE FEAR</h3>
<center>From 'Pseudoxia Epidemica'</center>
<br>
<p>Many other accounts like these we meet sometimes in history,
scandalous unto Christianity, and even unto humanity; whose
verities not only, but whose relations, honest minds do deprecate.
For of sins heteroclital, and such as want either name or
precedent, there is ofttimes a sin even in their histories. We
desire no records of such enormities; sins should be accounted new,
that so they may be esteemed monstrous. They amit of monstrosity as
they fall from their rarity; for men count it venial to err with
their forefathers, and foolishly conceive they divide a sin in its
society. The pens of men may sufficiently expatiate without these
singularities of villainy; for as they increase the hatred of vice
in some, so do they enlarge the theory of wickedness in all. And
this is one thing that may make latter ages worse than were the
former; for the vicious examples of ages past poison the curiosity
of these present, affording a hint of sin unto seducible spirits,
and soliciting those unto the imitation of them, whose heads were
never so perversely principled as to invent them. In this kind we
commend the wisdom and goodness of Galen, who would not leave unto
the world too subtle a theory of poisons; unarming thereby the
malice of venomous spirits, whose ignorance must be contented with
sublimate and arsenic. For surely there are subtler venerations,
such as will invisibly destroy, and like the basilisks of heaven.
In things of this nature silence commendeth history: 'tis the
veniable part of things lost; wherein there must never rise a
Pancirollus, nor remain any register but that of hell.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM BROWNE</h2>
<h3>(1591-1643)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>mong the English poets fatuous for their imaginative
interpretation of nature, high rank must be given to William
Browne, who belongs in the list headed by Spenser, and including
Thomas Lodge, Michael Drayton, Nicholas Breton, George Wither, and
Phineas Fletcher. Although he shows skill and charm of style in
various kinds of verse, his name rests chiefly upon his largest
work, 'Britannia's Pastorals.' This is much wider in scope than the
title suggests, if one follows the definition given by Pope in his
'Discourse on Pastoral Poetry.' He says:--"A Pastoral is an
imitation of the action of a shepherd or one considered under that
character. The form of this imitation is dramatic, or narrated, or
mixed of both; the fable simple, the manners not too polite nor too
rustic; the thoughts are plain, yet admit a little quickness and
passion.... If we would copy Nature, it may be useful to take this
Idea along with us: that Pastoral is an image of what they call the
Golden Age. So that we are not to describe our shepherds as
shepherds at this day really are, but as they may be conceived then
to have been when the best of men followed the employment.... We
must therefore use some illusion to render a Pastoral delightful,
and this consists in exposing the best side only of a shepherd's
life, and in concealing its miseries."</p>
<p>In his 'Shepherd's Pipe,' a series of 'Eclogues' Browne follows
this plan; but 'Britannia's Pastorals' contains rambling stories of
Hamadryads and Oreads; figures which are too shadowy to seem real,
yet stand in exquisite woodland landscapes. When the story passes
to the yellow sands and "froth-girt rocks," washed by the crisped
and curling waves from "Neptune's silver, ever-shaking breast," or
when it touches the mysteries of the ocean world, over which
"Thetis drives her silver throne," the poet's fancy is as delicate
as when he revels in the earthy smell of the woods, where the
leaves, golden and green, hide from sight the feathered choir;
where glow the hips of scarlet berries; where is heard the dropping
of nuts; and where the active bright-eyed squirrels leap from tree
to tree.</p>
<p>The loves, hardships, and adventures of Marina, Celadyne,
Redmond, Fida, Philocel, Aletheia, Metanoia, and Amintas do not
hold the reader from delight in descriptions of the blackbird and
dove calling from the dewy branches; crystal streams lisping
through banks purple with violets, rosy with eglantine, or sweet
with wild thyme; thickets where the rabbits hide; sequestered nooks
on which the elms and alders throw long shadows; circles of green
grass made by dancing elves; rounded hills shut in by oaks, pines,
birches, and laurel, where shepherds pipe on oaten straws, or
shag-haired satyrs frolic and sleep; and meadows, whose carpets of
cowslip and mint are freshened daily by nymphs pouring out gentle
streams from crystal urns. Every now and then, huntsmen in green
dash through his sombre woods with their hounds in full cry;
anglers are seated by still pools, shepherds dance around the
May-pole, and shepherdesses gather flowers for garlands. Gloomy
caves appear, surrounded by hawthorn and holly that "outdares cold
winter's ire," and sheltering old hermits, skilled in simples and
the secret power of herbs. Sometimes the poet describes a choir
where the tiny wren sings the treble, Robin Redbreast the mean, the
thrush the tenor, and the nightingale the counter-tenor, while
droning bees fill in the bass; and shows us fairy haunts and
customs with a delicacy only equaled by Drayton and Herrick.</p>
<p>Several lyric songs of high order are scattered through the
'Pastorals,' and the famous 'Palinode on Man' is imbedded in the
Third Book as follows:--</p>
<blockquote>"I truly know<br>
How men are born and whither they shall go;<br>
I know that like to silkworms of one year,<br>
Or like a kind and wronged lover's tear,<br>
Or on the pathless waves a rudder's dint,<br>
Or like the little sparkles of a flint,<br>
Or like to thin round cakes with cost perfum'd,<br>
Or fireworks only made to be consum'd:<br>
I know that such is man, and all that trust<br>
In that weak piece of animated dust.<br>
The silkworm droops, the lover's tears soon shed,<br>
The ship's way quickly lost, the sparkle dead;<br>
The cake burns out in haste, the firework's done,<br>
And man as soon as these as quickly gone."</blockquote>
<p>Little is known of Browne's life. He was a native of Tavistock,
Devonshire; born, it is thought, in 1591, the son of Thomas Browne,
who is supposed by Prince in his 'Worthies of Devon' to have
belonged to a knightly family. According to Wood, who says "he had
a great mind in a little body," he was sent to Exeter College,
Oxford, "about the beginning of the reign of James I." Leaving
Oxford without a degree, he was admitted in 1612 to the Inner
Temple, London, and a little later he is discovered at Oxford,
engaged as private tutor to Robert Dormer, afterward Earl of
Carnarvon. In 1624 he received his degree of Master of Arts from
Oxford. He appears to have settled in Dorking, and after 1640
nothing more is heard of him. Wood thinks he died in 1645, but
there is an entry in the Tavistock register, dated March 27th,
1643, and reading "William Browne was buried" on that day. That he
was devoted to the streams, dales, and downs of his native
Devonshire is shown in the Pastorals, where he sings:--</p>
<blockquote>"Hail, thou my native soil! thou bless&egrave;d
plot<br>
Whose equal all the world affordeth not!<br>
Show me who can, so many crystal rills,<br>
Such sweet-cloth'd valleys or aspiring hills;<br>
Such wood-ground, pastures, quarries, wealthy mines;<br>
Such rocks in whom the diamond fairly shines."</blockquote>
<p>And in another place he says:--</p>
<blockquote>"And Tavy in my rhymes<br>
Challenge a due; let it thy glory be<br>
That famous Drake and I were born by thee."</blockquote>
<p>The First Book of 'Britannia's Pastorals' was written before its
author was twenty, and was published in 1631. The Second Book
appeared in 1616, and both were reprinted in 1625. The Third Book
was not published during Browne's life. The 'Shepherd's Pipe' was
published in 1614, and 'The Inner Temple Masque,' written on the
story of Ulysses and Circe, for representation in 1614, was first
published in Thomas Davies's edition of Browne's works (3 vols.,
1772). Two critical editions of value have been brought out in
recent years: one by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1868-69); and the
other by Gordon Goodwin and A.H. Bullen (1894).</p>
<p>"In the third song of the Second Book," says Mr. Bullen in his
preface,--</p>
<blockquote>"There is a description of a delightful grove, perfumed
with 'odoriferous buds and herbs of price,' where fruits hang in
gallant clusters from the trees, and birds tune their notes to the
music of running water; so fair a pleasaunce<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'that you are fain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you last walked to turn and
walk again.'</blockquote>
<br>
A generous reader might apply that description to Browne's poetry;
he might urge that the breezes which blew down these leafy alleys
and over those trim parterres were not more grateful than the
fragrance exhaled from the 'Pastorals'; that the brooks and birds
babble and twitter in the printed page not less blithely than in
that western Paradise. What so pleasant as to read of May-games,
true-love knots, and shepherds piping in the shade? of pixies and
fairy-circles? of rustic bridals and junketings? of angling,
hunting the squirrel, nut-gathering? Of such subjects William
Browne treats, singing like the shepherd in the 'Arcadia,' as
though he would never grow old. He was a happy poet. It was his
good fortune to grow up among wholesome surroundings whose gracious
influences sank into his spirit. He loved the hills and dales round
Tavistock, and lovingly described them in his verse. Frequently he
indulges in descriptions of sunrise and sunset; they leave no vivid
impression, but charm the reader by their quiet beauty. It cannot
be denied that his fondness for simple, homely images sometimes led
him into sheer fatuity; and candid admirers must also admit that,
despite his study of simplicity, he could not refrain from hunting
(as the manner was) after far-fetched outrageous
conceits."</blockquote>
<p>Browne is a poet's poet. Drayton, Wither, Herbert, and John
Davies of Hereford, wrote his praises. Mrs. Browning includes him
in her 'Vision of Poets,' where she says:--</p>
<blockquote>"Drayton and Browne,--with smiles they drew<br>
From outward Nature, still kept new<br>
From their own inward nature true."</blockquote>
<p>Milton studied him carefully, and just as his influence is
perceived in the work of Keats, so is it found in 'Comus' and in
'Lycidas.' Browne acknowledges Spenser and Sidney as his masters,
and his work shows that he loved Chaucer and Shakespeare.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairest, when by the rules of

with hope to win;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that by them a copy might be

<h2>HENRY HOWARD BROWNELL</h2>
<h3>(1820-1872)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>his poet, prominent among those who gained their chief
inspiration from the stirring events of the Civil War, was born in
Providence, Rhode Island, February 6th, 1820, and died in East
Hartford, Connecticut, October 31st, 1872. He was graduated at
Trinity College, Hartford, studied law, and was admitted to the
bar; but instead of the legal profession adopted that of a teacher,
and made his home in Hartford, which was the residence of his
uncle, the Bishop of Connecticut. Although Mr. Brownell soon became
known as a writer of verse, both grave and humorous, it was not
till the coming on of the Civil War that his muse found truest and
noblest expression. With a poet's sensitiveness he foresaw the
coming storm, and predicted it in verse that has the ring of an
ancient prophet; and when the crash came he sang of the great deeds
of warriors in the old heroic strain. Many of these poems, like
'Annus Memorabilis' and 'Coming,' were born of the great passion of
patriotism which took possession of him, and were regarded only as
the visions of a heated imagination. But when the storm burst it
was seen that he had the true vision. As the dreadful drama
unrolled, Brownell rose to greater issues, and became the war-poet
<i>par excellence</i>, the vigorous chronicler of great
actions.</p>
<p>He was fond of the sea, and ardently longed for the opportunity
to witness, if not to participate in, a sea-fight. His desire was
gratified in a singular way. He had printed in a Hartford paper a
very felicitous versification of Farragut's 'General Orders' in the
fight at the mouth of the Mississippi. This attracted Farragut's
attention, and he took steps to learn the name of the author. When
it was given, Commodore Farragut (he was not then Admiral) offered
Mr. Brownell the position of master's-mate on board the Hartford,
and attached the poet to him in the character of a private
secretary. Thus he was present at the fight of Mobile Bay. After
the war he accompanied the Admiral in his cruise in European
waters.</p>
<p>Although Brownell was best known to the country by his
descriptive poems, 'The River Fight' and 'The Bay Fight,' which
appear in his volume of collected works, 'War Lyrics,' his title to
be considered a true poet does not rest upon these only. He was
unequal in his performance and occasionally was betrayed by a
grotesque humor into disregard of dignity and finish; but he had
both the vision and the lyric grace of the builder of lasting
verse.</p>

whirl of scorpion stings,<br>

<h2>ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING</h2>
<h3>(1809-1861)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-i.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>t is interesting to step back sixty years into the lives of Miss
Mitford and her "dear young friend Miss Barrett," when the
<i>-esses</i> of "authoresses" and "poetesses" and "editresses" and
"hermitesses" make the pages sibilant; when 'Books of Beauty,' and
'Keepsakes,' and the extraordinary methods of "Finden's Tableaux"
make us wonder that literature survived; when Mr. Kenyon, taking
Miss Mitford "to the giraffes and the Diorama," called for "Miss
Barrett, a hermitess in Gloucester Place, who reads Greek as I do
French, who has published some translations from &AElig;schylus,
and some most striking poems,"--"Our sweet Miss Barrett! to think
of virtue and genius is to think of her." Of her own life Mrs.
Browning writes:--"As to stories, my story amounts to the
knife-grinder's, with nothing at all for a catastrophe. A bird in a
cage would have as good a story; most of my events and nearly all
my intense pleasure have passed in my thoughts."</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/browning_e.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Mrs. Browning</b></p>
<p>She was born at Burn Hall, Durham, on March 6th, 1809, and
passed a happy childhood and youth in her father's country house at
Hope End, Herefordshire. She was remarkably precocious, reading
Homer in the original at eight years of age. She said that in those
days "the Greeks were her demigods. She dreamed more of Agamemnon
than of Moses, her black pony." "I wrote verses very early, at
eight years old and earlier. But what is less common, the early
fancy turned into a will, and remained with me." At seventeen years
of age she published the 'Essay on Mind,' and translated the
'Prometheus' of &AElig;schylus. Some years later the family removed
to London, and here Elizabeth, on account of her continued delicate
health, was kept in her room for months at a time. The shock
following on the death of her brother, who was drowned before her
eyes in Torquay, whither she had gone for rest, completely
shattered her physically. Now her life of seclusion in her London
home began. For years she lay upon a couch in a large, comfortably
darkened room, seeing only the immediate members of her family and
a few privileged friends, and spending her days in writing and
study, "reading," Miss Mitford says, "almost every book worth
reading in almost every language." Here Robert Browning met her.
They were married in 1846, against the will of her father. Going
abroad immediately, they finally settled in Florence at the Casa
Guidi, made famous by her poem bearing the same name. Their home
became the centre of attraction to visitors in Florence, and many
of the finest minds in the literary and artistic world were among
their friends. Hawthorne, who visited them, describes Mrs. Browning
as "a pale, small person, scarcely embodied at all, at any rate
only substantial enough to put forth her slender fingers to be
grasped, and to speak with a shrill yet sweet tenuity of voice. It
is wonderful to see how small she is, how pale her cheek, how
bright and dark her eyes. There is not such another figure in the
world, and her black ringlets cluster down in her neck and make her
face look whiter." She died in Florence on the 30th of June, 1861,
and the citizens of Florence placed a tablet to her memory on the
walls of Casa Guidi.</p>
<p>The life and personality of Elizabeth Barrett Browning seem to
explain her poetry. It is a life "without a catastrophe," except
perhaps to her devoted father. And it is to this father's devotion
that some of Mrs. Browning's poetical sins are due; for by him she
was so pampered and shielded from every outside touch, that all the
woes common to humanity grew for her into awful tragedies. Her life
was abnormal and unreal,--an unreality that passed more or less
into everything she did. Indeed, her resuscitation after meeting
Robert Browning would mount into a miracle, unless it were realized
that nothing in her former life had been quite as woful as it
seemed. That Mrs. Browning was "a woman of real genius," even
Edward Fitzgerald allowed; and in speaking of Shelley, Walter
Savage Landor said, "With the exception of Burns, he [Shelley] and
Keats were inspired with a stronger spirit of poetry than any other
poet since Milton. I sometimes fancy that Elizabeth Barrett
Browning comes next." This is very high praise from very high
authority, but none too high for Mrs. Browning, for her best work
has the true lyric ring, that spontaneity of thought and expression
which comes when the singer forgets himself in his song and becomes
tuneful under the stress of the moment's inspiration. All of Mrs.
Browning's work is buoyed up by her luxurious and overflowing
imagination. With all its imperfections of technique, its lapses of
taste and faults of expression, it always remains poetry, throbbing
with passion and emotion and rich in color and sound. She wrote
because she must. Her own assertions notwithstanding, one cannot
think of Mrs. Browning as sitting down in cold blood to compose a
poem according to fixed rules of art. This is the secret of her
shortcomings, as it is also the source of her strength, and in her
best work raises her high above those who, with more technical
skill, have less of the true poet's divine fire and overflowing
imagination.</p>
<p>So in the 'Sonnets from the Portuguese,' written at a time when
her woman's nature was thrilled to its very depths by the love of
her "most gracious singer of high poems," and put forth as
translations from another writer and tongue--in these her
imperfections drop away, and she soars to marvelous heights of
song. Such a lyric outburst as this, which reveals with magnificent
frankness the innermost secrets of an ardently loving woman's
heart, is unequaled in literature. Here the woman-poet is strong
and sane; here she is free from obscurity and mannerism, and from
grotesque rhymes. She has stepped out from her life of visions and
of morbid woes into a life of wholesome reality and of "sweet
reasonableness." Their literary excellence is due also to the fact
that in the sonnet Mrs. Browning was held to a rigid form, and was
obliged to curb her imagination and restrain her tendency to
diffuseness of expression. Mr. Saintsbury goes so far as to say
that the sonnet beginning--</p>
<blockquote>"If thou wilt love me, let it be for naught<br>
Except for love's sake only--"</blockquote>
<p>does not fall far short of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>'Aurora Leigh' gives rise to the old question, Is it advisable
to turn a three-volume novel into verse? Yet Landor wrote about
it:--"I am reading a poem full of thought and fascinating with
fancy--Mrs. Browning's (Aurora Leigh.) In many places there is the
wild imagination of Shakespeare.... I am half drunk with it. Never
did I think I should have a good draught of poetry again." Ruskin
somewhere considered it the greatest poem of the nineteenth
century, "with enough imagination to set up a dozen lesser poets";
and Stedman calls it "a representative and original creation:
representative in a versatile, kaleidoscopic presentment of modern
life and issues; original, because the most idiosyncratic of its
author's poems. An audacious speculative freedom pervades it, which
smacks of the New World rather than the Old.... 'Aurora Leigh' is a
mirror of contemporary life, while its learned and beautiful
illustrations make it almost a handbook of literature and the
arts.... Although a most uneven production, full of ups and downs,
of capricious or prosaic episodes, it nevertheless contains poetry
as fine as its author has given us elsewhere, and enough spare
inspiration to set up a dozen smaller poets. The flexible verse is
noticeably her own, and often handled with as much spirit as
freedom." Mrs. Browning herself declared it the most mature of her
works, "and the one into which my highest convictions upon life and
art have entered." Consider this:--</p>
<blockquote>"For 'tis not in mere death that men die most:<br>
And after our first girding of the loins<br>
In youth's fine linen and fair broidery,<br>
To run up-hill and meet the rising sun,<br>
We are apt to sit tired, patient as a fool,<br>
While others gird us with the violent bands<br>
Of social figments, feints, and formalisms,<br>
Reversing our straight nature, lifting up<br>
Our base needs, keeping down our lofty thoughts,<br>
Head downwards on the cross-sticks of the world.<br>
Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross.<br>
God, set our feet low and our foreheads high,<br>
And teach us how a man was made to walk!"</blockquote>
<p>Or this:--</p>
<blockquote>"I've waked and slept through many nights and days<br>
Since then--but still that day will catch my breath<br>
Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed,<br>
In which the fibrous years have taken root<br>
So deeply, that they quiver to their tops<br>
Whene'er you stir the dust of such a day."</blockquote>
<p>Again:--</p>
<blockquote>"Passion is<br>
But something suffered after all--<br>
. . . . . While Art<br>
<br>
Sets action on the top of suffering."</blockquote>
<p>And this:--</p>
<blockquote>"Nothing is small!<br>
No lily-muffled hum of summer-bee<br>
But finds some coupling with the spinning stars;<br>
No pebble at your foot but proves a sphere:<br>
. . . . . Earth's crammed with Heaven,<br>
And every common bush afire with God;<br>
But only he who sees, takes off his shoes."</blockquote>
<p>Among Mrs. Browning's smaller poems, 'Crowned and Buried' is,
notwithstanding serious defects of technique, one of the most
virile things she has written; indeed, some of her finest lines are
to be found in it. In 'The Cry of the Children' and in 'Cowper's
Grave' the pathos is most true and deep. 'Lord Walter's Wife' is an
even more courageous vindication of the feminine essence than
'Aurora Leigh'; and her 'Vision of Poets' is said to "vie in beauty
with Tennyson's own." The fine thought and haunting beauty of 'A
Musical Instrument,' with its matchless climax, need not be dwelt
on.</p>
<p>During her fifteen years' residence in Florence she threw
herself with great enthusiasm into Italian affairs, and wrote some
political poems of varying merit, whose interest necessarily faded
away when the occasion passed. But among those poems inspired by
the struggle for freedom, 'Casa Guidi Windows' comes close to the
'Sonnets from the Portuguese' and 'Aurora Leigh,' and holds an
enduring place for its high poetry, its musical, sonorous verse,
and the sustained intellectual vigor of composition. Her volume of
'Last Poems' contains, among much inferior matter, some of her
finest and most touching work, as 'A Musical Instrument,' 'The
Forced Recruit,' and 'Mother and Poet,' Peter Bayne says of her in
his 'Great Englishwomen':--"In melodiousness and splendor of poetic
gift Mrs. Browning stands ... first among women. She may not have
the knowledge of life, the insight into character, the
comprehensiveness of some, but we must all agree that a poet's far
more essential qualities are hers: usefulness, fervor, a noble
aspiration, and above all a tender, far-reaching nature, loving and
beloved, and touching the hearts of her readers with some virtue
from its depths. She seemed even in her life something of a spirit;
and her view of life's sorrow and shame, of its hearty and eternal
hope, is something like that which one might imagine a spirit's to
be." Whether political, or sociological, or mystical, or
sentimental, or impossible, there is about all that Mrs. Browning
has written an enduring charm of picturesqueness, of romance, and
of a pure enthusiasm for art. "Art for Art," she cries,</p>
<blockquote>"And good for God, himself the essential Good!<br>
We'll keep our aims sublime, our eyes erect,<br>
Although our woman-hands should shake and fail."</blockquote>
<p>This was her achievement--her hands did not fail!</p>
<p>Her husband's words will furnish, perhaps, the best conclusion
to this slight study:--"You are wrong," he said, "quite wrong--she
has genius; I am only a painstaking fellow. Can't you imagine a
clever sort of angel who plots and plans, and tries to build up
something,--he wants to make you see it as he sees it, shows you
one point of view, carries you off to another, hammering into your
head the thing he wants you to understand; and whilst this bother
is going on, God Almighty turns you off a little star--that's the
difference between us. The true creative power is hers, not
mine."</p>

INSTRUMENT</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT was he doing, the great god
Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down in the reeds by the river?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spreading
ruin and scattering ban,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splashing and paddling with hoofs of
a goat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breaking the golden lilies
afloat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the
dragon-fly on the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore out a reed, the great god
Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the
deep, cool bed of the river.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limpid water turbidly ran,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the broken lilies a-dying
lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dragon-fly had fled away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere he
brought it out of the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High on the shore sat the great god
Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
turbidly flowed the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hacked and hewed as a great god
can,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hard bleak steel at the
patient reed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till there was not a sign of the leaf
indeed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To prove it
fresh from the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He cut it short, did the great god
Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(How tall it
stood in the river!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then drew the pith, like the heart of
a man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily from the outside ring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And notched the poor, dry, empty
thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In holes as
he sat by the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This is the way," laughed the great
god Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Laughed
while he sat by the river,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The only way, since gods began<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sweet music, they could
succeed."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in
the reed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He blew in
power by the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Piercing
sweet by the river!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun on the hill forgot to
die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lilies revived, and the
dragon-fly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came back to
dream on the river.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet half a beast is the great god
Pan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To laugh as
he sits by the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Making a poet out of a man:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The true gods sigh for the cost and
the pain,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reed which grows nevermore
again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a reed
with the reeds in the river.</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Dying in his absence abroad, and
referring to the poem in which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recorded the sweetness of her
eyes.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the door you will not enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gazed
too long: adieu!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope withdraws her
"peradventure";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death is near me,--and not
<i>you!</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, O
lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close and
cover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These poor eyes you called, I
ween,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweetest eyes were ever seen!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I heard you sing that burden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my vernal days and
bowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other praises disregarding,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I but hearkened that of
yours,<br>

heart-playing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blessed eyes mine eyes have
been,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the sweetest HIS have seen!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all changes. At this vesper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold the sun shines down
the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you stood there, would you
whisper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Love, I love you," as
before,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death
pervading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now and
shading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes you sang of, that yestreen,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I think, were you beside

therein,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the light which has foregone

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would we give to our
beloved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hero's heart to be unmoved.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poet's star-tuned
harp to sweep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patriot's voice to teach and
rouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The monarch's crown to light the
brows?--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we give to our beloved?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little faith all undisproved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little dust to
overweep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter memories to make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole earth blasted for our
sake.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth his beloved
sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sleep soft, beloved!" we sometimes
say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have no tune to charm away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad dreams that through
the eyelids creep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But never doleful dream again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall break the happy slumber
when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O earth, so full of dreary
noises!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O men with wailing in your
voices!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O delv&egrave;d gold the
wailers heap!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O strife, O curse, that o'er it
fall!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God strikes a silence through you
all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And giveth his beloved
sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dews drop mutely on the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cloud above it saileth still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though on its slope men
sow and reap;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More softly than the dew is shed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cloud is floated overhead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, men may wonder while they
scan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living, thinking, feeling man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confirmed in such a rest
to keep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But angels say,--and through the
word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think their happy smile is
<i>heard</i>,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, my heart that erst did go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most like a tired child at a
show,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sees through tears
the mummers leap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would now its wearied vision
close,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would childlike on His love
repose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And friends, dear friends, when it
shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this low breath is gone from
me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round my bier ye come
to weep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let one most loving of you all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, "Not a tear must o'er her
fall!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He giveth his
belov&egrave;d sleep."</blockquote>

CHILDREN</b><br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye hear the children weeping, O my
brothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the
sorrow comes with years?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are leaning their young heads
against their mothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
<i>that</i> cannot stop their tears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young lambs are bleating in the
meadows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young birds are
chirping in the nest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young fawns are playing with the
shadows;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young flowers are
blowing toward the west:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young, young children, O my
brothers!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are
weeping bitterly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are weeping in the playtime of
the others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
country of the free.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you question the young children in
their sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why their
tears are falling so?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man may weep for his
To-morrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is lost
in Long-Ago;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old tree is leafless in the
forest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old year is ending in
the frost;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old wound, if stricken, is the
sorest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old hope is hardest
to be lost:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the young, young children, O my
brothers!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ask
them why they stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weeping sore before the bosoms of
their mothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our happy
Fatherland?<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look up with their pale and
sunken faces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their
looks are sad to see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the man's hoary anguish draws and
presses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the
cheeks of infancy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your old earth," they say, "is very
dreary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our young feet," they
say, "are very weak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few paces have we taken, yet are
weary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our grave-rest is very
far to seek.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask the aged why they weep, and not
the children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the
outside earth is cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we young ones stand without in
our bewildering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the
graves are for the old."<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"True," say the children, "it may
happen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That we die
before our time:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Alice died last year; her
grave is shapen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a
snowball in the rime.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We looked into the pit prepared to
take her:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was no room for any work
in the close clay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the sleep wherein she lieth none
will wake her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crying, 'Get up, little
Alice! it is day.'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you listen by that grave, in sun
and shower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your ear down,
little Alice never cries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we see her face, be sure we
should not know her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the smile has time
for growing in her eyes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And merry go her moments, lulled and
stilled in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shroud by the
kirk-chime.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is good when it happens," say the
children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That we die
before our time."<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, alas, the children! They are
seeking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death in
life, as best to have.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are binding up their hearts away
from breaking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a
cerement from the grave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out, children, from the mine and
from the city;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing out, children, as
the little thrushes do;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck your handfuls of the
meadow-cowslips pretty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh aloud, to feel your
fingers let them through.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they answer, "Are your cowslips
of the meadows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like our
weeds anear the mine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave us quiet in the dark of the
coal-shadows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From your
pleasures fair and fine.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VI</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For oh!" say the children, "we are
weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we cannot
run or leap;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cared for any meadows, it were
merely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drop down
in them, and sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our knees tremble sorely in the
stooping;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fall upon our faces,
trying to go;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, underneath our heavy eyelids
drooping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reddest flower would
look as pale as snow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all day we drag our burden
tiring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the
coal-dark, underground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or all day we drive the wheels of
iron<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
factories, round and round.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VII</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For all-day the wheels are droning,
turning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wind
comes in our faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till our hearts turn, our heads with
pulses burning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the walls
turn in their places.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns the sky in the high window
blank and reeling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns the long light that
drops adown the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the black flies that crawl along
the ceiling,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are turning, all the
day, and we with all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all day the iron wheels are
droning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes
we could pray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'O ye wheels' (breaking out in a mad
moaning),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Stop! be
silent for to-day!'"<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VIII</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay. be silent! Let them hear each
other breathing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment,
mouth to mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them touch each other's hands, in
a fresh wreathing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of their
tender human youth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them feel that this cold metallic
motion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not all the life God
fashions or reveals;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them prove their living souls
against the notion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they live in you, or
tinder you, O wheels!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still all day the iron wheels go
onward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grinding life
down from its mark;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children's souls, which God
is calling sunward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spin on
blindly in the dark.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IX</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell the poor young children, O
my brothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To look up to
Him, and pray;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the bless&egrave;d One who
blesseth all the others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bless
them another day.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They answer, "Who is God, that he
should hear us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the rushing of the
iron wheels is stirred?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we sob aloud, the human
creatures near us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by, hearing not, or
answer not a word;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>we</i> hear not (for the
wheels in their resounding)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers
speaking at the door.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it likely God, with angels singing
round him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears our
weeping any more?<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Two words, indeed, of praying we
remember;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at
midnight's hour of harm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Father,' looking upward in the
chamber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We say softly
for a charm.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know no other words except 'Our
Father';<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we think that, in
some pause of angels' song,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God may pluck them with the silence
sweet to gather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hold both within his
right hand, which is strong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Our Father!' If he heard us, he
would surely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For they
call him good and mild)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer, smiling down the steep world
very purely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Come and
rest with me, my child.'<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XI</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But no!" say the children, weeping
faster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He is
speechless as a stone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they tell us, of his image is the
master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who commands
us to work on.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to!" say the children,--"up in
heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark, wheel-like, turning
clouds are all we find.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not mock us: Grief has made us
unbelieving:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look up for God; but
tears have made us blind."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you hear the children weeping and
disproving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my
brothers, what ye preach?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For God's possible is taught by his
world's loving--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the
children doubt of each.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XII</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well may the children weep before
you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are
weary ere they run;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have never seen the sunshine,
nor the glory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is
brighter than the sun.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They know the grief of man, without
its wisdom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sink in man's
despair, without its calm;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are slaves, without the liberty in
Christdom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are martyrs, by the pang
without the palm;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are worn as if with age, yet
unretrievingly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harvest of its
memories cannot reap;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are orphans of the earthly love and
heavenly--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let them
weep! let them weep!<br>
<br>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XIII</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look up with their pale and
sunken faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their
look is dread to see.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For they mind you of their angels in
high places,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes
turned on Deity.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How long," they say, "how long, O
cruel nation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you stand, to move
the world on a child's heart,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stifle down with a mailed heel its
palpitation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tread onward to your
throne amid the mart?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our blood splashes upward, O
gold-heaper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your
purple shows your path;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the child's sob in the silence
curses deeper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than the
strong man in his wrath!"</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[On Laura Savio of Turin, a poetess
and patriot, whose sons were killed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Ancona and Gaeta.]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEAD! One of them shot by the sea in
the east,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them shot in
the west by the sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! both my boys! When you sit at
the feast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And are wanting a great
song for Italy free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none look
at <i>me</i>!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I was a poetess only last
year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good at my art, for a
woman, men said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But <i>this</i> woman, <i>this</i>,
who is agonized here,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The east sea and west sea
rhyme on in her head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forever
instead.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art can a woman be good at? Oh,
vain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art <i>is</i> she
good at, but hurting her breast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the milk-teeth of babes, and a
smile at the pain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, boys, how you hurt!
you were strong as you prest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I proud
by that test.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What art's for a woman? To hold on
her knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both darlings! to feel
all their arms round her throat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cling, strangle a little! to sew by
degrees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 'broider the
long-clothes and neat little coat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dream and
to dote.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach them.... It stings there!
<i>I</i> made them indeed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak plain the word
<i>country. I</i> taught them, no doubt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a country's a thing men should
die for at need.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prated of liberty,
rights, and about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tyrant
cast out.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when their eyes flashed ... O my
beautiful eyes! ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I exulted; nay, let them
go forth at the wheels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the guns, and denied not. But then
the surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one sits quite
alone! Then one weeps, then one kneels.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, how the
house feels!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, happy news came, in gay
letters moiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my kisses, of
camp-life and glory, and how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both loved me; and soon, coming
home to be spoiled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return would fan off
every fly from my brow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their
green laurel-bough.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was triumph at Turin: "Ancona
was free!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some one came out of
the cheers in the street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a face pale as stone, to say
something to me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Guido was dead! I fell
down at his feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they
cheered in the street.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bore it; friends soothed me; my
grief looked sublime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ransom of Italy.
One boy remained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be leant on and walked with,
recalling the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the first grew
immortal, while both of us strained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the height
<i>he</i> had gained.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And letters still came; shorter,
sadder, more strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writ now but in one
hand:--"I was not to faint,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One loved me for two; would be with
me ere long:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <i>Viva l'Italia</i>
he died for, our saint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who forbids
our complaint."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Nanni would add, "he was safe, and
aware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a presence that turned
off the balls,--was imprest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Guido himself, who knew what I
could bear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how 'twas impossible,
quite dispossest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live on
for the rest."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On which, without pause, up the
telegraph-line<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept smoothly the next
news from Gaeta,--"<i>Shot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell his mother</i>." Ah, ah! "his,"
"their" mother, not "mine":<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No voice says, "<i>My</i>
mother," again to me. What!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think
Guido forgot?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are souls straight so happy, that,
dizzy with heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They drop earth's
affections, conceive not of woe?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think not! Themselves were too
lately forgiven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through that Love and
that Sorrow which reconciled so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Above and
Below.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Christ of the seven wounds, who
look'dst through the dark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the face of thy
mother! Consider, I pray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How we common mothers stand desolate,
mark,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sons, not being
Christs, die with eyes turned away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no last
word to say!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both boys dead? but that's out of
nature. We all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been patriots, yet
each house must always keep one.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere imbecile, hewing out roads to
a wall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when Italy's made,
for what end is it done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we have
not a son?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, ah, ah! when Gaeta's taken, what
then?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the fair wicked
queen sits no more at her sport<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the fire-balls of death crashing
souls out of men;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the guns of Cavalli
with final retort<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have cut the
game short;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Venice and Rome keep their new
jubilee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your flag takes all
heaven for its white, green, and red:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <i>you</i> have your country
from mountain to sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When King Victor has
Italy's crown on his head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I have
my dead)--<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What then? Do not mock me. Ah, ring
your bells low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And burn your lights
faintly! <i>My</i> country is <i>there</i>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the star pricked by the last
peak of snow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Italy's THERE, with my
brave civic pair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To
disfranchise despair!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me. Some women bear children
in strength,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bite back the cry of
their pain in self-scorn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the birth-pangs of nations will
wring us at length<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into wail such as this,
and we sit on forlorn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the
man-child is born.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead! One of them shot by the sea in
the east,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one of them shot in
the west by the sea.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both! both my boys! If in keeping the
feast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want a great song for
your Italy free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let none look
at <i>me</i>!</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A COURT LADY</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair was tawny with gold; her
eyes with purple were dark;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks' pale opal burnt with a
red and restless spark.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was lady of Milan nobler in
name and in race;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was lady of Italy fairer to see
in the face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never was lady on earth more true as
woman and wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Larger in judgment and instinct,
prouder in manners and life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in the early morning, and
said to her maidens, "Bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That silken robe made ready to wear
at the court of the King.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bring me the clasps of diamond,
lucid, clear of the mote;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clasp me the large at the waist, and
clasp me the small at the throat.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Diamonds to fasten the hair, and
diamonds to fasten the sleeves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laces to drop from their rays, like a
powder of snow from the eaves."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gorgeous she entered the sunlight,
which gathered her up in a flame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, straight in her open carriage,
she to the hospital came.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In she went at the door, and gazing
from end to end,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Many and low are the pallets; but
each is the place of a friend."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up she passed through the wards, and
stood at a young man's bed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloody the band on his brow, and
livid the droop of his head.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou a Lombard, my brother?
Happy art thou!" she cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled like Italy on him: he
dreamed in her face--and died.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pale with his passing soul, she went
on still to a second:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a grave hard man, whose years
by dungeons were reckoned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounds in his body were sore, wounds
in his life were sorer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou a Romagnole?" Her eyes
drove lightnings before her.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Austrian and priest had joined to
double and tighten the cord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Able to bind thee, O strong one, free
by the stroke of a sword.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now be grave for the rest of us,
using the life overcast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ripen our wine of the present (too
new) in glooms of the past."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down she stepped to a pallet where
lay a face like a girl's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young, and pathetic with dying,--a
deep black hole in the curls.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Art thou from Tuscany, brother? and
seest thou, dreaming in pain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mother stand in the piazza,
searching the list of the slain?"<br>
<br>
Kind as a mother herself, she touched his cheeks with her
hands:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Blessed is she who has borne thee,
although she should weep as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
she stands."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On she passed to a Frenchman, his arm
carried off by a ball:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kneeling: "O more than my brother!
how shall I thank thee for all?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Each of the heroes around us has
fought for his land and line;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou hast fought for a stranger,
in hate of a wrong not thine.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Happy are all free peoples, too
strong to be dispossest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But blessed are those among nations
who dare to be strong for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever she passed on her way, and came
to a couch where pined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One with a face from Venetia, white
with a hope out of mind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long she stood and gazed, and twice
she tried at the name;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But two great crystal tears were all
that faltered and came.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a tear for Venice? She turned as
in passion and loss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stooped to his forehead and
kissed it, as if she were kissing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cross.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faint with that strain of heart, she
moved on then to another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stern and strong in his death: "And
dost thou suffer, my brother?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding his hands in hers: "Out of
the Piedmont lion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cometh the sweetness of freedom!
sweetest to live or to die on."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding his cold rough hands: "Well,
oh well have ye done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In noble, noble Piedmont, who would
not be noble alone."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back he fell while she spoke. She
rose to her feet with a spring.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That was a Piedmontese! and this is
the court of the King!"</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sigh the glass dim

grown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cubit-space, and say,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By anguish which made pale the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The battle hurtles on the
plains--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth feels new scythes
upon her:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We reap our brothers for the
wains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call the
harvest--honor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draw face to face, front line to
line,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One image all
inherit:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then kill, curse on, by that same
sign,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clay, clay,--and spirit,
spirit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We meet together at the feast--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To private mirth betake
us--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stare down in the winecup,
lest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some vacant chair should
shake us!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We name delight, and pledge it
round--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It shall be ours
to-morrow!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's seraphs! do your voices
sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sad in naming
sorrow?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sit together, with the skies,<br>

above us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look into each other's eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And how long will you
love us?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes grow dim with prophecy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voices, low and
breathless--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Till death us part!"--O words, to
be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our <i>best</i> for love
the deathless!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, dear God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tremble by the harmless bed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one loved and
departed--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our tears drop on the lips that
said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night, "Be
stronger-hearted!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God,--to clasp those fingers
close,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet to feel so
lonely!--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see a light upon such brows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is the daylight
only!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The happy children come to us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look up in our
faces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ask us--Was it thus, and
thus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were in their
places?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot speak--we see anew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills we used to live
in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And feel our mother's smile press
through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kisses she is
giving.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray together at the kirk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mercy, mercy,
solely--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hands weary with the evil work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lift them to the
Holy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse is calm below our
knee--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its spirit bright before
Thee--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between them, worse than either,
we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the rest of
glory!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be
pitiful, O God!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon all vision waxeth dull--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men whisper, "He is
dying;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cry no more, "Be pitiful!"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no strength for
crying:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No strength, no need! Then, Soul of
mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up and triumph
rather--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! in the depth of God's Divine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Son adjures the
Father--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE
PITIFUL, O GOD!</blockquote>

NEST</b><br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Ellie sits
alone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid the beeches of a meadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By a stream-side on the
grass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the trees are
showering down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubles of their leaves in
shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her shining hair and
face.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She has thrown her
bonnet by;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And her feet she has been dipping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shallow water's
flow--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she holds them
nakedly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her hands, all sleek and
dripping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she rocketh to and
fro.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Ellie sits
alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the smile she softly uses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fills the silence like a
speech;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While she thinks what
shall be done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sweetest pleasure
chooses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For her future within
reach.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little Ellie in her
smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chooseth--"I will have a lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Riding on a steed of
steeds!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shall love me without
guile;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to <i>him</i> I will discover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That swan's nest among
the reeds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the steed shall be
red-roan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lover shall be noble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With an eye that takes
the breath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the lute he plays
upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall strike ladies into trouble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As his sword strikes men
to death.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the steed it shall
be shod<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in silver, housed in
<i>azure</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the mane shall swim
the wind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the hoofs along the
sod<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall flash onward and keep
measure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the shepherds look
behind.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But my lover will not
prize<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the glory that he rides in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he gazes in my
face.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will say, 'O Love,
thine eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build the shrine my soul abides
in;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I kneel here for thy
grace.'<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then, ay, then--he
shall kneel low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the red-roan steed anear
him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which shall seem to
understand--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till I answer, 'Rise and
go!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the world must love and fear
him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom I gift with heart
and hand.'<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he will arise so
pale,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall feel my own lips tremble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a <i>yes</i> I must
not say--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nathless maiden-brave,
'Fare well,'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will utter, and dissemble--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Light to-morrow with
to-day.'<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then he'll ride among
the hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the wide world past the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There to put away all
wrong:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make straight
distorted wills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to empty the broad quiver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which the wicked bear
along.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Three times shall a
young foot-page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swim the stream and climb the
mountain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And kneel down beside my
feet--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Lo! my master sends
this gage,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady, for thy pity's counting!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What wilt thou exchange
for it?'<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the first time I
will send<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A white rosebud for a guerdon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the second time, a
glove:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the third time--I
may bend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my pride, and
answer--'Pardon--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If he come to take my
love.'<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then the young
foot-page will run--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then my lover will ride faster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till he kneeleth at my
knee:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am a duke's eldest
son!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousand serfs do call me
master,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, O Love, I love but
<i>thee!</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He will kiss me on the
mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then; and lead me as a lover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the crowds that
praise his deeds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when soul-tied by one
troth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto <i>him</i> I will discover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swan's nest among
the reeds."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Ellie, with her
smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet ended, rose up gayly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied the bonnet, donned
the shoe--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And went homeward, round
a mile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to see, as she did daily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What more eggs were with
the <i>two</i>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pushing through the
elm-tree copse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winding by the stream,
light-hearted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the osier pathway
leads--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the boughs she
stoops--and stops!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! the wild swan had deserted--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a rat had gnawed the
reeds.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ellie went home sad and
slow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she found the lover ever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his red-roan steed
of steeds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooth I know not! but I
know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She could never show him--never,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That swan's nest among
the reeds!</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike are we, unlike, O princely
Heart!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike our uses and our
destinies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ministering two
angels look surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one another as they strike
athwart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wings in passing. Thou, bethink
thee, art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A guest for queens to
social pageantries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With gages from a hundred
brighter eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than tears even can make mine, to
play thy part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of chief musician. What
hast <i>thou</i> to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With looking from the lattice-lights
at me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poor, tired, wandering
singer, singing through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark, and leaning up a cypress
tree?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chrism is on thine
head; on mine the dew:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Death must dig the level where
these agree.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast thy calling to some
palace-floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most gracious singer of
high poems, where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dancers will break
footing, from the care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of watching up thy pregnant lips for
more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dost thou lift this house's
latch, too poor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For hand of thine? and
canst thou think, and bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let thy music drop
here unaware<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In folds of golden fulness at my
door?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up, and see the
casement broken in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bats and owlets builders in the
roof!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cricket chirps against
thy mandolin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush, call no echo up in further
proof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of desolation! there's a
voice within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That weeps--as thou must sing--alone,
aloof.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I give thee back, O
liberal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And princely giver, who
hast brought the gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purple of thine
heart, unstained, untold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid them on the outside of the
wall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For such as I to take or leave
withal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In unexpected largesse?
Am I cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ungrateful, that for
these most manifold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High gifts, I render nothing back at
all?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so; not cold, but
very poor instead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ask God, who knows. For frequent
tears have run<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colors from my life,
and left so dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pale a stuff, it were not fitly
done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give the same as
pillow to thy head.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go farther! let it serve to trample
on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou must love me, let it be for
naught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for love's sake
only. Do not say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I love her for her
smile, her look, her way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of speaking gently, for a trick of
thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That falls in well with mine, and
certes brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sense of pleasant ease
on such a day:"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For these things in
themselves, beloved, may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be changed, or change for thee; and
love so wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May be unwrought so.
Neither love me for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine own dear pity's wiping my
cheeks dry:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A creature might forget
to weep, who bore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy comfort long, and lose thy love
thereby.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But love me for love's
sake, that evermore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou mayst love on through love's
eternity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First time he kissed me, he but only
kissed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fingers of this hand
wherewith I write;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And ever since it grew
more clean and white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow to world-greetings, quick with
its "Oh list!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the angels speak. A ring of
amethyst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could not wear here
plainer to my sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than that first kiss.
The second passed in height<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, and sought the forehead,
and half missed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half falling on the
hair. Oh, beyond meed!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the chrism of love, which
love's own crown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With sanctifying
sweetness did precede.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third upon my lips was folded
down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In perfect purple state;
since when, indeed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been proud, and said "My love,
my own!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I LIVED with visions for my
company,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of men and
women, years ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And found them gentle
mates, nor thought to know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweeter music than they played to
me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon their trailing purple was
not free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this world's dust,
their lutes did silent grow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I myself grew faint
and blind below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst
come--to be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beloved, what they
seemed. Their shining fronts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their songs, their splendors (better,
yet the same,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As river-water hallowed
into fonts),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Met in thee, and from out thee
overcame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul with
satisfaction of all wants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because God's gifts put man's best
dreams to shame.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BELOVED, my beloved, when I think<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That thou wast in the
world a year ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What time I sat alone
here in the snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw no footprint, heard the
silence sink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No moment at thy voice, but, link by
link,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went counting all my
chains as if that so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They never could fall
off at any blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck by thy possible hand--why,
thus I drink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of life's great cup of
wonder! Wonderful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to feel thee thrill the day or
night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With personal act or
speech, nor ever cull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some prescience of thee with the
blossoms white<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sawest growing!
Atheists are as dull,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot guess God's presence out
of sight.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BECAUSE thou hast the power and
own'st the grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To look through and
behind this mask of me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Against which years
have beat thus blanchingly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With their rains!) and behold my
soul's true face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim and weary witness of life's
race;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because thou hast the
faith and love to see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through that same soul's
distracting lethargy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The patient angel waiting for his
place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the new heavens;
because nor sin nor woe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor God's infliction, nor death's
neighborhood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor all which others
viewing, turn to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor all which makes me tired of all,
self-viewed,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing repels
thee.--Dearest, teach me so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pour out gratitude, as thou dost,
good!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I THANK all who have loved me in
their hearts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With thanks and love
from mine. Deep thanks to all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who paused a little near
the prison-wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear my music in its louder
parts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they went onward, each one to the
mart's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or temple's occupation,
beyond call.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thou, who in my
voice's sink and fall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sob took it, thy divinest
Art's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Own instrument didst
drop down at thy foot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hearken what I said between my
tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instruct me how to thank
thee!--Oh, to shoot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul's full meaning into future
years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That <i>they</i> should
lend it utterance, and salute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love that endures! with Life that
disappears!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do I love thee? Let me count the
ways.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee to the depth
and breadth and height<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My soul can reach, when
feeling out of sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ends of Being and Ideal
Grace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee to the level of every
day's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most quiet need, by sun
and candle-light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee freely, as
men strive for Right;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee purely, as they turn from
Praise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee with the
passion put to use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my old griefs, and with my
childhood's faith;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love thee with a love I
seemed to lose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my lost saints,--I love thee
with the breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiles, tears, of all my
life!--and if God choose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall but love thee better after
death.</blockquote>

<h2>ROBERT BROWNING</h2>
<h3>(1812-1889)</h3>
<center>BY E.L. BURLINGAME</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-r.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>obert Browning was born at Camberwell on May 7th, 1812, the son
and grandson of men who held clerkships in the Bank of England--the
one for more than forty and the other for full fifty years. His
surroundings were apparently typical of English moderate
prosperity, and neither they, nor his good but undistinguished
family traditions, furnish any basis for the theorizing of
biographers, except indeed in a single point. His grandmother was a
West Indian Creole, and though only of the first generation to be
born away from England, seems, from the restless and adventurous
life led by her brother, to have belonged to a family of the
opposite type from her husband's. Whether this crossing of the
imaginative, Westward-Ho strain of the English blood with the
home-keeping type has to do with the production of such intensely
vitalized temperaments as Robert Browning's, is the only question
suggested by his ancestry. It is noticeable that his father wished
to go to a university, then to become an artist--- both ambitions
repressed by the grandfather; and that he took up his bank
official's career unwillingly. He seems to have been anything but a
man of routine; to have had keen and wide interests outside of his
work; to have been a great reader and book collector, even an
exceptional scholar in certain directions; and to have kept till
old age a remarkable vivacity, with unbroken health--altogether a
personality thoroughly sympathetic with that of his son, to whom
this may well have been the final touch of a prosperity calculated
to shake all traditional ideas of a poet's youth.</p>
<p>Browning's education was exceptional, for an English boy's. He
left school at fourteen, and after that was taught by tutors at
home, except that at eighteen he took a Greek course at the London
University. His training seems to have been unusually thorough for
these conditions, though largely self-directed; it may be supposed
that his father kept a sympathetic and intelligent guidance, wisely
not too obvious. But in the main it is clear that from a very early
age, Browning had deliberately and distinctly in view the idea of
making literature the pursuit of his life, and that he troubled
himself seriously with nothing that did not help to that end; while
into everything that did he seems to have thrown himself with
precocious intensity. Individual anecdotes of his precocity are
told by his biographers; but they are flat beside the general fact
of the depth and character of his studies, and superfluous of the
man who had written 'Pauline' at twenty-one and 'Paracelsus' at
twenty-two. At eighteen he knew himself as a poet, and encountered
no opposition in his chosen career from his father, whose "kindness
we must seek," as Mrs. Sutherland Orr says, "not only in this
first, almost inevitable assent to his son's becoming a writer, but
in the subsequent unfailing readiness to support him in his
literary career. 'Paracelsus,' 'Sordello,' and the whole of 'Bells
and Pomegranates' were published at his father's expense, and,
incredible as it appears, brought him no return." An aunt, Mrs.
Silverthorne, paid the costs of the earlier 'Pauline.'</p>
<p>From this time of his earliest published work ('Pauline' was
issued without his name in 1833) that part of the story of his life
known to the public, in spite of two or three more or less
elaborate biographies, is mainly the history of his writings and
the record of his different residences, supplemented by less than
the usual number of personal anecdotes, to which neither
circumstance nor temperament contributed material. He had nothing
of the attitude of the recluse, like Tennyson; but while healthily
social and a man of the world about him, he was not one of whom
people tell "reminiscences" of consequence, and he was in no sense
a public personality. Little of his correspondence has appeared in
print; and it seems probable that he will be fortunate, to an even
greater degree than Thackeray, in living in his works and escaping
the "ripping up" of the personal chronicler.</p>
<p>He traveled occasionally in the next few years, and in 1838 and
again in 1844 visited Italy. In that year, or early in 1845, he
became engaged to Miss Elizabeth Barrett, their acquaintance
beginning through a friend,--her cousin,--and through letters from
Browning expressing admiration for her poems. Miss Barrett had then
been for some years an invalid from an accident, and an enforced
recluse; but in September 1846 they were married without the
knowledge of her father, and almost immediately afterward (she
leaving her sick room to join him) went to Paris and then to Italy,
where they lived first in Genoa and afterward in Florence, which
with occasional absences was their home for fourteen years. Mrs.
Browning died there, at Casa Guidi, in June 1861. Browning left
Florence some time afterward, and in spite of his later visits to
Italy, never returned there. He lived again in London in the
winter, but most of his summers were spent in France, and
especially in Brittany. About 1878 he formed the habit of going to
Venice for the autumn, which continued with rare exceptions to the
end of his life. There in 1888 his son, recently married, had made
his home; and there on the 12th of December, 1889, Robert Browning
died. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on the last day of the
year.</p>

<p>'Pauline, a Fragment of a Confession,' Browning's first
published poem, was a psychological self-analysis, perfectly
characteristic of the time of life at which he wrote it,--very
young, full of excesses of mood, of real exultation, and somewhat
less real depression--the "confession" of a poet of twenty-one,
intensely interested in the ever-new discovery of his own nature,
its possibilities, and its relations. It rings very true, and has
no decadent touch in it:--</p>
<blockquote>"I am made up of an intensest life<br>
... a principle of restlessness<br>
Which would be all, have, see, know, taste, feel,
all--"</blockquote>
<p>this is the note that stays in the reader's mind. But the poem
is psychologically rather than poetically noteworthy--except as all
beginnings are so; and Browning's statement in a note in his
collected poems that he "acknowledged and retained it with extreme
repugnance," shows how fully he recognized this.</p>
<p>In 'Paracelsus,' his next long poem, published some two years
later, the strength of his later work is first definitely felt.
Taking for theme the life of the sixteenth-century physician,
astrologer, alchemist, conjuror,--compound of Faust and Cagliostro,
mixture of truth-seeker, charlatan, and dreamer,--Browning makes of
it the history of the soul of a feverish aspirant after the
finality of intellectual power, the knowledge which should be for
man the key to the universe; the tragedy of its failure, and the
greater tragedy of its discovery of the barrenness of the effort,
and the omission from its scheme of life of an element without
which power was impotent.</p>
<blockquote>"Yet, constituted thus and thus endowed,<br>
I failed; I gazed on power till I grew blind.<br>
Power--I could not take my eyes from that;<br>
That only I thought should be preserved, increased.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
I learned my own deep error: love's undoing<br>
Taught me the worth of love in man's estate,<br>
And what proportion love should hold with power<br>
In his right constitution; love preceding<br>
Power, and with much power always much more love."</blockquote>
<p>'Paracelsus' is the work of a man still far from maturity; but
it is Browning's first use of a type of poem in which his powers
were to find one of their chief manifestations--a psychological
history, told with so slight an aid from "an external machinery of
incidents" (to use his own phrase), or from conventional dramatic
arrangement, as to constitute a form virtually new.</p>
<p>This was to be notably the method of 'Sordello,' which appeared
in 1840. In a note written twenty-three years later to his friend
Milsand, and prefixed as a dedication to 'Sordello' in his
collected works, he defined the form and its reason most
exactly:--"The historical decoration was purposely of no more
importance than a background requires, and my stress lay on the
incidents in the development of a soul; little else is worth
study." This poem, with its "historical decoration" or "background"
from the Guelf and Ghibelline struggles in Italy, carries out this
design in a fashion that defies description or characterization.
With its inexhaustible wealth of psychological suggestion, its
interwoven discussion of the most complex problems of life and
thought, its metaphysical speculation, it may well give pause to
the reader who makes his first approach to Browning through it, and
send him back,--if he begins, as is likely, with the feeling of one
challenged to an intellectual task,--baffled by the intricacy of
its ways and without a comprehension of what it contains or leads
to. Mr. Augustine Birrell says of it:--</p>
<blockquote>"We have all heard of the young architect who forgot to
put a staircase in his house, which contained fine rooms but no way
of getting into them. 'Sordello' is a poem without a staircase. The
author, still in his twenties, essayed a high thing. For his
subject<br>
<br>
<blockquote>'He singled out<br>
Sordello compassed murkily about<br>
With ravage of six long sad hundred years.'</blockquote>
<br>
"He partially failed; and the British public, with its accustomed
generosity, and in order, I suppose, to encourage the others, has
never ceased girding at him because, forty-two years ago, he
published at his own charges a little book of two hundred and fifty
pages, which even such of them as were then able to read could not
understand."</blockquote>
<p>With 'Sordello,' however, ended for many years--until he may
perhaps be said to have taken it up in a greatly disciplined and
more powerful form in 'The Ring and the Book' and others--this type
and this length of the psychological poem for Browning; and now
began that part of his work which is his best gift to English
literature.</p>
<p>Four years before the publication of 'Sordello' he had written
one play, 'Strafford,' of which the name sufficiently indicates the
subject, which had been put upon the stage with some success by
Macready;--the forerunner of a noble series of poems in dramatic
form, most conveniently mentioned here together, though not always
in chronological order. They were 'The Blot on the 'Scutcheon,'
perhaps the finest of those actually fitted for the stage;
'Colombe's Birthday'; 'King Victor and King Charles'; 'The Return
of the Druses'; 'Luria'; 'A Soul's Tragedy'; 'In a Balcony';
and,--though less on the conventional lines of a play than the
others,--perhaps the finest dramatic poem of them all, 'Pippa
Passes,' which, among the earlier (it was published in 1841), is
also among the finest of all Browning's works, and touches the very
highest level of his powers.</p>
<p>Interspersed with these during the fifteen years between 1840
and 1855, and following them during the next five, appeared the
greater number of the single shorter poems which make his most
generally recognized, his highest, and his unquestionably permanent
title to rank among the first of English poets. Manifestly, it is
impossible and needless to recall any number of these here by even
the briefest description; and merely to enumerate the chief among
them would be to repeat a familiar catalogue, except as they
illustrate the points of a later general consideration.</p>
<p>Finally, to complete the list of Browning's works, reference is
necessary to the group of books of his later years: the two
self-called narrative poems, 'The Ring and the Book,' with its vast
length, and 'Red Cotton Nightcap Country,' its fellow in method if
not in extent. Mr. Birrell (it is worth while to quote him again,
as one who has not merged the appreciator in the adulator) calls
'The Ring and the Book' "a huge novel in 20,000 lines--told after
the method not of Scott, but of Balzac; it tears the hearts out of
a dozen characters; it tells the same story from ten different
points of view. It is loaded with detail of every kind and
description: you are let off nothing." But he adds later:--"If you
are prepared for this, you will have your reward; for the style,
though rugged and involved, is throughout, with the exception of
the speeches of counsel, eloquent and at times superb: and as for
the matter--if your interest in human nature is keen, curious,
almost professional; if nothing man, woman, or child has been,
done, or suffered, or conceivably can be, do, or suffer, is without
interest for you; if you are fond of analysis, and do not shrink
from dissection--you will prize 'The Ring and the Book' as the
surgeon prizes the last great contribution to comparative anatomy
or pathology."</p>
<p>This is the key of the matter: the reader who has learned,
through his greater work, to follow with interest the very analytic
exercises, and as it were <i>tours de force</i> of Browning's mind,
will prize 'The Ring and the Book' and 'Red Cotton Nightcap
Country'; even he will prize but little the two 'Adventures of
Balaustion,' 'Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangau,' 'The Inn Album,' and
one or two others of the latest works in the same <i>genre</i>. But
he can well do without them, and still have the inexhaustible
left.</p>
<p>The attitude of a large part of his own generation toward
Browning's poetry will probably be hardly understood by the future,
and is not easy to comprehend even now for those who have the whole
body of his work before them. It is intelligible enough that the
"crude preliminary sketch" 'Pauline' should have given only the
bare hint of a poet to the few dozen people who saw that it was out
of the common; that 'Paracelsus' should have carried the
information,--though then, beyond a doubt, to only a small circle;
and especially that 'Sordello,' a clear call to a few, should have
sounded to even an intelligent many like an exercise in intricacy,
and to the world at large like something to which it is useless to
listen. Or, to look at the other end of his career, it is not
extraordinary that the work of his last period--'The Ring and the
Book,' 'Red Cotton Nightcap Country,'--those wonderful minute
studies of human motive, made with the highly specialized skill of
the psychical surgeon and with the confidence of another Balzac in
the reader's following power--should always remain more or less
esoteric literature. But when it is remembered that between these
lie the most vivid and intensely dramatic series of short poems in
English,--those grouped in the unfortunately diverse editions of
his works under the rubrics 'Men and Women,' 'Dramatic Lyrics,'
'Dramatic Romances,' 'Dramatis Person&aelig;,' and the rest, as
well as larger masterpieces of the broad appeal of 'Pippa Passes,'
'A Blot on the 'Scutcheon,' or 'In a Balcony,'--it is hard to
understand, and will be still harder fifty years hence, why
Browning has not become the familiar and inspiring poet of a vastly
larger body of readers. Undoubtedly a large number of intelligent
persons still suspect a note of affectation in the man who declares
his full and intense enjoyment--not only his admiration--of
Browning; a suspicion showing not only the persistence of the
Sordello-born tradition of "obscurity," but the harm worked by
those commentators who approach him as a problem. Not all
commentators share this reproach; but as Browning makes Bishop
Blougram say:--</p>
<blockquote>"Even your prime men who appraise their kind<br>
Are men still, catch a wheel within a wheel,<br>
See more in a truth than the truth's simple self--<br>
Confuse themselves--"</blockquote>
<p>and beyond question such persons are largely responsible for the
fact that for some time to come, every one who speaks of Browning
to a general audience will feel that he has some cant to clear
away. If he can make them read this body of intensely human,
essentially simple and direct dramatic and lyrical work, he will
help to bring about the time when the once popular attitude will
seem as unjustifiable as to judge Goethe only by the second part of
'Faust.'</p>
<p>The first great characteristic of Browning's poetry is
undoubtedly the essential, elemental quality of its humanity--a
trait in which it is surpassed by no other English poetry but that
of Shakespeare. It can be subtile to a degree almost fantastic (as
can Shakespeare's to an extent that familiarity makes us forget);
but this is in method. The stuff of it--the texture of the fabric
which the swift and intricate shuttle is weaving--is always
something in which the human being is vitally, not merely
aesthetically interested. It deals with no shadows, and indeed with
few abstractions, except those that form a part of vital
problems--a statement which may provoke the scoffer, but will be
found to be true.</p>
<p>A second characteristic, which, if not a necessary result of
this first, would at least be impossible without it, is the extent
to which Browning's poetry produces its effect by suggestion rather
than by elaboration; by stimulating thought, emotion, and the
aesthetic sense, instead of seeking to satisfy any one of
these--especially instead of contenting itself with only soothing
the last. The comparison of his poetry with--for
instance--Tennyson's, in this respect, is instructive; if it is
possibly unjust to both.</p>
<p>And a third trait in Browning--to make an end of a dangerously
categorical attempt to characterize him--follows logically from
this second; its extreme compactness and concentration. Browning
sometimes dwells long--even dallies--over an idea, as does
Shakespeare; turns it, shows its every facet; and even then it is
noticeable, as with the greater master, that every individual
phrase with which he does so is practically exhaustive of the
suggestiveness of that particular aspect. But commonly he crowds
idea upon idea even in his lyrics, and--strangely enough--without
losing the lyric quality; each thought pressed down to its very
essence, and each with that germinal power that makes the reading
of him one of the most stimulating things to be had from
literature. His figures especially are apt and telling in the very
minimum of words; they say it all, like the unsurpassable
Shakespearean example of "the dyer's hand"; and the more you think
of them, the more you see that not a word could be added or taken
away.</p>
<p>It may be said that this quality of compactness is common to all
genius, and of the very essence of all true poetry; but Browning
manifested it in a way of his own, such as to suggest that he
believed in the subordination of all other qualities to it; even of
melody, for instance, as may be said by his critics and admitted in
many cases by even his strongest admirers. But all things are not
given to one, even among the giants; and Browning's force with its
measure of melody (which is often great) has its place among
others' melody with its measure of force. Open at random: here are
two lines in 'A Toccata of Galuppi's,' not deficient in melody by
any means:--</p>
<blockquote>"Dear dead women--with such hair, too: what's become of
all the gold<br>
Used to hang and brush their bosoms?--I feel chilly and grown
old."</blockquote>
<p>This is not Villon's 'Ballad of Dead Ladies,' nor even
Tennyson's 'Dream of Fair Women'; but a master can still say a good
deal in two lines.</p>
<p>What is called the "roughness" of Browning's verse is at all
events never the roughness that comes from mismanagement or
disregard of the form chosen. He has an unerring ear for time and
quantity; and his subordination to the laws of his metre is
extraordinary in its minuteness. Of ringing lines there are many;
of broadly sonorous or softly melodious ones but few; and
especially (if one chooses to go into details of technic) he seems
curiously without that use of the broad vowels which underlies the
melody of so many great passages of English poetry. Except in the
one remarkable instance of 'How we Carried the Good News from Ghent
to Aix,' there is little onomatopoeia, and almost no note of the
flute; no "moan of doves in immemorial elms" or "lucent sirops
tinct with cinnamon." On the other hand, in his management of
metres like that of 'Love Among the Ruins,' for instance, he shows
a different side; the pure lyrics in 'Pippa Passes' and elsewhere
sing themselves; and there are memorable cadences in some of the
more meditative poems, like 'By the Fireside.'</p>
<p>The vividness and vigor and truth of Browning's embodiments of
character come, it is needless to say, from the same power that has
created all great dramatic work,--the capacity for incarnating not
a quality or an ideal, but the mixture and balance of qualities
that make up the real human being. There is not a walking phantom
among them, or a lay-figure to hang sentiment on. A writer in the
New Review said recently that of all the poets he remembered, only
Shakespeare and Browning never drew a prig. It is this complete
absence of the false note that gives to certain of Browning's poems
the finality which is felt in all consummate works of art, great
and small; the sense that they convey, if not the last word, at
least the last necessary word, on their subject. 'Andrea del Sarto'
is in its way the whole problem of the artist-ideal, the weak will
and the inner failure, in all times and guises; and at the other
end of the gamut, nobody will ever need again to set forth Bishop
Blougram's attitude, or even that of Mr. Sludge the Medium. Of the
informing, almost exuberant vitality of all the lyric and dramatic
poems, it is needless to speak; that fairly leaps to meet the
reader at every page of them, and a quality of it is their
essential optimism.</p>
<blockquote>"What is he buzzing in my ears?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I come to die.<br>
Do I view the world as a vale of tears?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, reverend sir, not I!"</blockquote>
<p>The world was never a vale of tears to Robert Browning, man or
poet; but a world of men and women, with plenty of red corpuscles
in their blood.</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CALLED "THE FAULTLESS PAINTER"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not let us quarrel any
more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my Lucrezia! bear with me for
once:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sit down and all shall happen as you
wish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You turn your face, but does it bring
your heart?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll work then for your friend's
friend, never fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treat his own subject after his own
way?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix his own time, accept too his own
price,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shut the money into this small
hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When next it takes mine. Will it?
tenderly?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I'll content him,--but to-morrow,
Love!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I often am much wearier than you
think,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This evening more than usual: and it
seems<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if--forgive now--should you let me
sit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here by the window, with your hand in
mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look a. half-hour forth on
Fiesole,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of one mind, as married people
use,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quietly, quietly the evening
through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might get up to-morrow to my
work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerful and fresh as ever. Let us
try.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow, how you shall be glad for
this!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your soft hand is a woman of
itself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mine, the man's bared breast she
curls inside.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't count the time lost, neither:
you must serve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For each of the five pictures we
require;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It saves a model. So! keep looking
so--My<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serpentining beauty, rounds on
rounds!--How<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could you ever prick those perfect
ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to put the pearl there! oh, so
sweet--My<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face, my moon, my everybody's
moon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which everybody looks on and calls
his,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I suppose is looked on by in
turn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While she looks--no one's: very dear,
no less.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You smile? why, there's my picture
ready made;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's what we painters call our
harmony!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common grayness silvers
everything,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a twilight, you and I
alike--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You at the point of your first pride
in me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That's gone, you know)--but I at
every point,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My youth, my hope, my art being all
toned down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's the bell clinking from the
chapel-top;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That length of convent-wall across
the way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds the trees safer, huddled more
inside;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last monk leaves the garden; days
decrease,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And autumn grows, autumn in
everything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eh? the whole seems to fall into a
shape,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if I saw alike my work and
self<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all that I was born to be and
do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A twilight piece. Love, we are in
God's hand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strange now looks the life he
makes us lead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So free we seem, so fettered fast we
are!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel he laid the fetter: let it
lie!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This chamber, for example--turn your
head--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that's behind us! You don't
understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor care to understand about my
art,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you can hear at least when people
speak:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that cartoon, the second from the
door--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the thing, Love! so such things
should be;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold Madonna!--I am bold to
say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can do with my pencil what I
know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I see, what at bottom of my
heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish for, if I ever wish so
deep--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do easily, too--when I say
perfectly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not boast, perhaps: yourself are
judge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who listened to the Legate's talk
last week;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just as much they used to say in
France,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At any rate 'tis easy, all of it!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sketches first, no studies, that's
long past:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do what many dream of, all their
lives--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dream? strive to do, and agonize to
do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fail in doing. I could count
twenty such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On twice your fingers, and not leave
this town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who strive--you don't know how the
others strive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To paint a little thing like that you
smeared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carelessly passing with your robes
afloat,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do much less, so much less, Some
One says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I know his name, no matter)--so much
less!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, less is more, Lucrezia: I am
judged.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There burns a truer light of God in
them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their vexed, beating, stuffed, and
stopped-up brain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart, or whate'er else, than goes on
to prompt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This low-pulsed forthright
craftsman's hand of mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their works drop groundward, but
themselves, I know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reach many a time a heaven that's
shut to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter and take their place there sure
enough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they come back and cannot tell
the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My works are nearer heaven, but I sit
here.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sudden blood of these men! at a
word--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise them, it boils; or blame them,
it boils too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, painting from myself and to
thyself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know what I do, am unmoved by men's
blame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or their praise either. Somebody
remarks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morello's outline there is wrongly
traced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hue mistaken: what of that? or
else,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rightly traced and well ordered: what
of that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak as they please, what does the
mountain care?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but a man's reach should exceed
his grasp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what's a heaven for? All is
silver-gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placid and perfect with my art: the
worse!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know both what I want and what
might gain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet how profitless to know, to
sigh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Had I been two, another and
myself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our head would have o'erlooked the
world" No doubt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder's a work now, of that famous
youth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Urbinate who died five years
ago.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;('Tis copied, George Vasari sent it
me.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I can fancy how he did it
all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring his soul, with kings and
popes to see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reaching, that heaven might so
replenish him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above and through his art--for it
gives way:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That arm is wrongly put--and there
again--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fault to pardon in the drawing's
lines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its body, so to speak; its soul is
right;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He meant right--that, a child may
understand.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, what an arm! and I could alter
it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the play, the insight, and
the stretch--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of me, out of me! And wherefore
out?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you enjoined them on me, given me
soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might have risen to Rafael, I and
you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay, Love, you did give all I asked,
I think--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than I merit, yes, by many
times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But had you--oh, with the same
perfect brow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And perfect eyes, and more than
perfect mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the low voice my soul hears, as a
bird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fowler's pipe, and follows to the
snare--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you, with these, these same, but
brought a mind!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some women do so. Had the mouth there
urged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"God and the glory! never care for
gain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present by the future, what is
that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live for fame, side by side with
Agnolo!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rafael is waiting: up to God, all
three!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might have done it for you. So it
seems:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps not. All is as God
overrules.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside, incentives come from the
soul's self;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest avail not. Why do I need
you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wife had Rafael, or has
Agnolo?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world, who can do a thing,
will not;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who would do it, cannot, I
perceive:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the will's somewhat--somewhat,
too, the power--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus we half-men struggle. At the
end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, I conclude, compensates,
punishes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis safer for me, if the award be
strict,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I am something underrated
here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor this long while,--despised, to
speak the truth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dared not, do you know, leave home
all day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear of chancing on the Paris
lords.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best is when they pass and look
aside;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they speak sometimes: I must bear
it all.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well may they speak! That Francis,
that first time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that long festal year at
Fontainebleau!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I surely then could sometimes leave
the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on the glory, Rafael's daily
wear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that humane great monarch's golden
look,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One finger in his beard or twisted
curl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over his mouth's good mark that made
the smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One arm about my shoulder, around my
neck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jingle of his gold chain in my
ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I painting proudly with his breath on
me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All his court round him, seeing with
his eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such frank French eyes, and such a
fire of souls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Profuse, my hand kept plying by those
hearts,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And best of all, this, this, this
face beyond,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This in the background, waiting on my
work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To crown the issue with a last
reward!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good time, was it not, my kingly
days,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And had you not grown restless ...
but I know--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis done and past; 'twas right, my
instinct said;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too live the life grew, golden and
not gray;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'm the weak-eyed bat no sun
should tempt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the grange whose four walls
make his world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could it end in any other
way?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You called me, and I came home to
your heart.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The triumph was to have ended there;
then, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reached it ere the triumph, what is
lost?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my hands frame your face in your
hair's gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You beautiful Lucrezia that are
mine!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rafael did this, Andrea painted
that;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roman's is the better when you
pray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the other Virgin was his
wife"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men will excuse me. I am glad to
judge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both pictures in your presence;
clearer grows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My better fortune, I resolve to
think,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For, do you know, Lucrezia, as God
lives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said one day Agnolo, his very
self,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Rafael--I have known it all these
years--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(When the young man was flaming out
his thoughts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a palace wall for Rome to
see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too lifted up in heart because of
it)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Friend, there's a certain sorry
little scrub<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes up and down our Florence, none
cares how,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, were he set to plan and
execute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you are, pricked on by your popes
and kings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would bring the sweat into that brow
of yours!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Rafael's!--and indeed the arm is
wrong.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hardly dare ... yet, only you to
see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give the chalk here--quick, thus the
line should go!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, but the soul! he's Rafael! rub it
out!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all I care for, if he spoke
the truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(What he? why, who but Michel
Agnolo?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you forget already words like
those?)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If really there was such a chance so
lost,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is, whether you're--not grateful--but
more pleased.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let me think so. And you smile
indeed!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hour has been an hour! Another
smile?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would sit thus by me every
night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should work better--do you
comprehend?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean that I should earn more, give
you more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, it is settled dusk now: there's
a star;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morello's gone, the watch lights show
the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cue-owls speak the name we call
them by.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come from the window, love,--come in,
at last,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the melancholy little
house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We built to be so gay with. God is
just.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Francis may forgive me: oft at
nights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I look up from painting, eyes
tired out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walls become illumined, brick
from brick<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distinct, instead of mortar, fierce
bright gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gold of his I did cement them
with!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us but love each other. Must you
go?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That cousin here again? he waits
outside?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must see you--you, and not with me?
Those loans?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More gaming debts to pay? you smiled
for that?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let smiles buy me! have you
more to spend?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While hand and eye and something of a
heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are left me, work's my ware, and
what's it worth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll pay my fancy. Only let me
sit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gray remainder of the evening
out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Idle, you call it, and muse
perfectly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I could paint were I but back in
France,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One picture, just one more--the
Virgin's face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yours this time! I want you at my
side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear them--that is, Michel
Agnolo--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge all I do and tell you of its
worth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you? To-morrow satisfy your
friend.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the subjects for his
corridor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finish the portrait out of
hand--there, there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And throw him in another thing or
two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he demurs: the whole should prove
enough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pay for this same cousin's freak.
Beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's better, and what's all I care
about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get you the thirteen send for the
ruff!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, does that please you? Ah, but
what does he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cousin! what does he to please
you more?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grown peaceful as old age
to-night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret little, I would change still
less.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there my past life lies, why
alter it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very wrong to Francis!--it is
true<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took his coin, was tempted and
complied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And built this house and sinned, and
all is said.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father and my mother died of
want.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, had I riches of my own? you
see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How one gets rich! Let each one bear
his lot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were born poor, lived poor, and
poor they died;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I have labored somewhat in my
time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And not been paid profusely. Some
good son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint my two hundred pictures--let
him try!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, there's something strikes a
balance. Yes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You loved me quite enough, it seems
to-night.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This must suffice me here. What would
one have?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In heaven, perhaps, new chances, one
more chance--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four great walls in the New
Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meted on each side by the angel's
reed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Leonard, Rafael, Agnolo, and
me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cover--the three first without a
wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I have mine! So still they
overcome--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because there's still Lucrezia,--as I
choose.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the cousin's whistle! Go, my
love.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A TOCCATA OF
GALUPPI'S</b><br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O GALLUPI, Baldassaro, this is very
sad to find!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can hardly misconceive
you; it would prove me deaf and blind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But although I take your meaning,
'tis with such a heavy mind!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you come with your old music,
and here's all the good it brings?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, they lived once thus at Venice
where the merchants were the kings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Saint Mark's is, where the
Doges used to wed the sea with rings?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, because the sea's the street
there; and 'tis arched by--what you call--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shylock's bridge with houses on it,
where they kept the carnival:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was never out of England--it's as
if I saw it all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did young people take their pleasure
when the sea was warm in May?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Balls and masks begun at midnight,
burning ever to mid-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they made up fresh adventures
for the morrow, do you say?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a lady such a lady, cheeks so
round and lips so red,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her neck the small face buoyant,
like a bell-flower on its bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the breast's superb abundance
where a man might base his head?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, and it was graceful of them:
they'd break talk off and afford--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She to bite her mask's black velvet,
he to finger on his sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you sat and played Toccatas,
stately at the clavichord!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What? Those lesser thirds so
plaintive, sixths diminished, sigh on sigh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told them something? Those
suspensions, those solutions--"Must we die?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those commiserating sevenths--"Life
might last! we can but try!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Were you happy?" "Yes."--"And are
you still as happy?" "Yes. And you?"--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then, more kisses!" "Did <i>I</i>
stop them, when a million seemed so few?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark, the dominant's persistence till
it must be answered to!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, an octave struck the answer. Oh,
they praised you, I dare say!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Brave Galuppi! that was music! good
alike at grave and gay!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can always leave off talking when I
hear a master play!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they left you for their
pleasure; till in due time, one by one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some with lives that came to nothing,
some with deeds as well undone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death stepped tacitly, and took them
where they never see the sun.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I sit down to reason, think
to take my stand nor swerve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I triumph o'er a secret wrung
from nature's close reserve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In you come with your cold music till
I creep through every nerve.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you, like a ghostly cricket,
creaking where a house was burned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust and ashes, dead and done with,
Venice spent what Venice earned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul, doubtless, is
immortal--where a soul can be discerned.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Yours for instance: you know
physics, something of geology,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematics are your pastime; souls
shall rise in their degree;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Butterflies may dread
extinction,--you'll not die, it cannot be!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As for Venice and her people, merely
born to bloom and drop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on earth they bore their
fruitage, mirth and folly were the crop;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of soul was left, I wonder, when
the kissing had to stop?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dust and ashes!" So you creak it,
and I want the heart to scold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear dead women, with such hair,
too--what's become of all the gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used to hang and brush their bosoms?
I feel chilly and grown old.</blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is he buzzing in my ears?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now that I come to
die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I view the world as a vale of
tears?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, reverend sir, not
I!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I viewed there once,--what I
viewed again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the physic bottles
stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the table's edge,--is a suburb
lane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a wall to my bedside
hand.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lane sloped, much as the bottles
do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a house you could
descry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the garden wall: is the curtain
blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or green to a healthy
eye?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mine, it serves for the old June
weather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue above lane and
wall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that farthest bottle labeled
"Ether"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the house o'ertopping
all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a terrace, somewhat near the
stopper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There watched for me,
one June,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A girl: I know, sir, it's
improper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My poor mind's out of
tune.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, there was a way--you crept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Close by the side, to
dodge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes in the house, two eyes
except:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They styled their house
"The Lodge"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What right had a lounger up their
lane?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But by creeping very
close,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the good wall's help,--their
eyes might strain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stretch themselves
to O's,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet never catch her and me
together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she left the attic
there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the rim of the bottle labeled
"Ether,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And stole from stair to
stair,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stood by the rose-wreathed gate.
Alas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We loved, sir--used to
meet:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How sad and bad and mad it was--<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Up like fires<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the hundred-gated circuit of a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lust of glory pricked their hearts

Struck them tame;<br>

now, breathless, dumb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet reserved a thousand chariots in
full force--<br>

mountain side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make for the city!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew the signal, and stepped on
with pride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over men's pity;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Left play for work, and grappled with
the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent on escaping:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's in the scroll," quoth he,
"thou keepest furled?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Show me their
shaping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs who most studied man, the bard
and sage,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give!" so he gowned
him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight got by heart that book to
its last page;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learned, we found
him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, but we found him bald too, eyes
like lead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accents uncertain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Time to taste life," another would
have said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up with the
curtain!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man said rather, "Actual life
comes next?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience a moment!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant I have mastered learning's
crabbed text,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still there's the
comment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me know all! Prate not of most or
least,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painful or easy!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to the crumbs I'd fain eat up
the feast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, nor feel queasy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, such a life as he resolved to
live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had learned
it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he had gathered all books had to
give!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner, he spurned
it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Image the whole, then execute the
parts--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fancy the fabric<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite, ere you build, ere steel
strike fire from quartz,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere mortar dab brick!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Here's the town-gate reached;
there's the market-place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaping before us.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, this in him was the peculiar
grace:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Hearten our chorus!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That before living he'd learn how to
live--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No end to learning:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earn the means first--God surely will
contrive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use for our earning.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others mistrust and say, "But time
escapes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live now or never!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said, "What's time? Leave Now for
dogs and apes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man has Forever."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to his book then: deeper drooped
his head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calculus</i> racked
him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaden before, his eyes grew dross of
lead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tussis</i> attacked
him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, master, take a little
rest!"--not he!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Caution redoubled!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step two abreast, the way winds
narrowly!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a whit troubled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to his studies, fresher than at
first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce as a dragon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He (soul-hydroptic with a sacred
thirst)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sucked at the flagon.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, if we draw a circle
premature,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heedless of far gain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy for quick returns of profit,
sure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bad is our bargain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it not great? did not he throw on
God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He loves the
burthen)--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's task to make the heavenly
period<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect the earthen?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not he magnify the mind, show
clear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just what it all
meant?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would not discount life, as fools
do here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid by installment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ventured neck or nothing--heaven's
success<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Found, or earth's
failure:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilt thou trust death or not?" He
answered, "Yes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence with life's pale
lure!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That low man seeks a little thing to
do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees it and does it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high man, with a great thing to
pursue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dies ere he knows it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That low man goes on adding one to
one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hundred's soon
hit:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This high man, aiming at a
million,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misses an unit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, has the world here--should he
need the next.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the world mind
him!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, throws himself on God, and
unperplexed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking shall find
him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, with the throttling hands of
death at strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground he at grammar;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, through the rattle, parts of
speech were rife:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he could
stammer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He settled <i>Hoti's</i>
business--let it be!--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Properly based
<i>Oun</i>--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave us the doctrine of the enclitic
<i>De</i>,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead from the waist
down.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, here's the platform, here's the
proper place:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail to your
purlieus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ye highfliers of the feathered
race,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swallows and curlews!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's the top-peak; the multitude
below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Live, for they can,
there:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man decided not to Live but
Know--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bury this man there?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here--here's his place, where meteors
shoot, clouds form,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lightnings are
loosened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stars come and go! Let joy break with
the storm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace let the dew
send!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lofty designs must close in like
effects:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loftily lying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave him--still loftier than the
world suspects,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living and
dying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>MY LAST
DUCHESS</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FERRARA<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's my last Duchess painted on the
wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking as if she were alive. I
call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That piece a wonder, now: Fr&agrave;
Pandolf's hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked busily a day, and there she
stands.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will't please you sit and look at
her? I said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fr&agrave; Pandolf" by design: for
never read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers like you that pictured
countenance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The depth and passion of its earnest
glance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to myself they turned (since none
puts by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtain I have drawn for you, but
I),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed as they would ask me, if
they durst,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How such a glance came there; so, not
the first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir,
'twas not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband's presence only, called
that spot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of joy into the Duchess' cheek:
perhaps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fr&agrave; Pandolf chanced to say,
"Her mantle laps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over my lady's wrists too much," or
"Paint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must never hope to reproduce the
faint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-flush that dies along her
throat;" such stuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was courtesy, she thought, and cause
enough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For calling up that spot of joy. She
had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heart--how shall I say?--too soon
made glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too easily impressed: she liked
whate'er<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked on, and her looks went
everywhere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, 'twas all one! My favor at her
breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dropping of the daylight in the
West,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bough of cherries some officious
fool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broke in the orchard for her, the
white mule<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rode with round the terrace,--all
and each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would draw from her alike the
approving speech,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or blush, at least. She thanked
men,--good! but thanked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow--I know not how--as if she
ranked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old
name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to
blame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sort of trifling? Even had you
skill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speech (which I have not) to make
your will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clear to such an one, and say,
"Just this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that in you disgusts me; here you
miss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or there exceed the mark,"--and if
she let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly
set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made
excuse,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E'en then would be some stooping; and
I choose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to stoop. O sir! she smiled, no
doubt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When'er I passed her; but who passed
without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much the same smile? This grew; I
gave commands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all smiles stopped together.
There she stands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if alive. Will't please you rise?
We'll meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company below, then. I
repeat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Count your master's known
munificence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is ample warrant that no just
pretense<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mine for dowry will be
disallowed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though his fair daughter's self, as I
avowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At starting, is my object. Nay, we'll
go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Together down, sir. Notice Neptune,
though,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taming a sea-horse, thought a
rarity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in
bronze for me!</blockquote>

THE CITY</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(As DISTINGUISHED BY AN ITALIAN
PERSON OF QUALITY)<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I but plenty of money, money
enough and to spare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house for me, no doubt, were a
house in the city-square;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, such a life, such a life, as one
leads at the window there!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to see, by Bacchus,
something to hear, at least!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, the whole day long, one's life
is a perfect feast;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While up at a villa one lives, I
maintain it, no more than a beast.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, now, look at our villa! stuck
like the horn of a bull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just on a mountain edge as bare as
the creature's skull,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save a mere shag of a bush with
hardly a leaf to pull!--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scratch my own, sometimes, to see if
the hair's turned wool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the city, oh the city--the square
with the houses! Why!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are stone-faced, white as a
curd; there's something to take the eye!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Houses in four straight lines, not a
single front awry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You watch who crosses and gossips,
who saunters, who hurries by;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green blinds, as a matter of course,
to draw when the sun gets high;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the shops with fanciful signs
which are painted properly.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of a villa? Though winter be
over in March by rights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis May perhaps ere the snow shall
have withered well off the heights;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've the brown-plowed land before,
where the oxen steam and wheeze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hills over-smoked behind by
the faint gray olive-trees.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it better in May, I ask you?
You've summer all at once;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a day he leaps complete with a few
strong April suns.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid the sharp short emerald wheat,
scarce risen three fingers well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wild tulip, at end of its tube,
blows out its great red bell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a thin clear bubble of blood,
for the children to pick and sell.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it ever hot in the square? There's
a fountain to spout and splash!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the shade it sings and springs; in
the shine such foam-bows flash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the horses with curling
fish-tails, that prance and paddle and pash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the lady atop in her
conch--fifty gazers do not abash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though all that she wears is some
weeds round her waist in a sort of sash.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the year long at the villa,
nothing to see though you linger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except yon cypress that points like
death's lean lifted forefinger.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some think fireflies pretty, when
they mix i' the corn and mingle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thrid the stinking hemp till the
stalks of it seem a-tingle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late August or early September, the
stunning cicala is shrill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bees keep their tiresome
whine round the resinous firs on the hill.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enough of the seasons,--I spare you
the months of the fever and chill.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere you open your eyes in the city,
the bless&egrave;d church-bells begin;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner the bells leave off than
the diligence rattles in:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You get the pick of the news, and it
costs you never a pin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and by there's the traveling
doctor gives pills, lets blood, draws teeth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the Pulcinella-trumpet breaks up
the market beneath.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the post-office such a scene
picture--the new play, piping hot!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a notice how, only this morning,
three liberal thieves were shot.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above it, behold the Archbishop's
most fatherly of rebukes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beneath, with his crown and his
lion, some little new law of the Duke's!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a sonnet with flowery marge, to
the Reverend Don So-and-so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarca,
St. Jerome, and Cicero,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"And moreover" (the sonnet goes
rhyming), "the skirts of St. Paul has reached,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having preached us those six
Lent-lectures more unctuous than ever he preached."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon strikes,--here sweeps the
procession! our Lady borne smiling and smart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a pink gauze gown all spangles,
and seven swords stuck in her heart!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bang-whang-whang</i> goes the
drum, <i>tootle-te-tootle</i> the fife;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No keeping one's haunches still: it's
the greatest pleasure in life.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bless you, it's dear--it's dear!
fowls, wine, at double the rate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have clapped a new tax upon
salt, and what oil pays passing the gate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a horror to think of. And so,
the villa for me, not the city!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beggars can scarcely be choosers: but
still--ah, the pity, the pity!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, two and two go the priests,
then the monks with cowls and sandals,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then penitents dressed in white
shirts, a-holding the yellow candles;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, he carries a flag up straight,
and another a cross with handles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Duke's guard brings up the
rear, for the better prevention of scandals:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Bang-whang-whang</i> goes the
drum, <i>tootle-te-tootle</i> the fife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, a day in the city-square, there
is no such pleasure in life!</blockquote>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I shall see her in three days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just one night,--but nights are
short,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then two long hours, and that is
morn.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See how I come, unchanged,
unworn--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feel, where my life broke off from
thine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How fresh the splinters keep and
fine,--Only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a touch and we combine!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too long, this time of year, the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my eyes hold her! What is
worth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of heaven, the rest of
earth?<br>

store<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of warmth and scent, as once
before<br>

darks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outbreaking into fairy sparks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When under curl and curl I pried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the warmth and scent
inside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through lights and darks how
manifold--The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark inspired, the light
controlled!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As early Art embrowned the gold.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What great fear--should one say,
"Three days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That change the world might change as
well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your fortune; and if joy delays,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be happy that no worse befell."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What small fear--if another says,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Three days and one short night
beside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May throw no shadow on your ways;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But years must teem with change
untried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With chance not easily defied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an end somewhere
undescried."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No fear!--or if a fear be born<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never any more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I
live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Need I hope to see his face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once his love grown chill,<br>

still.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it something said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something
done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vexed him? was it touch of hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn of
head?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange! that very way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love
begun:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I as little understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love's
decay.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I sewed or drew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How he looked as if I sung,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweetly
too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I spoke a word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of
all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up his cheek the color sprung,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he
heard.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting by my side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At my
feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he breathed but air I
breathed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Satisfied!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, too, at love's brim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touched the
sweet:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would die if death bequeathed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet to
him.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Speak, I love thee best!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He
exclaimed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let thy love my own foretell!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
confessed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clasp my heart on thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now
unblamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since upon thy soul as well<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His
alone?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had wealth and ease,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beauty,
youth:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my lover gave me love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I gave
these.<br>

just,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the passion I had raised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To
content.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he chose to change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gold for
dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I gave him what he praised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it
strange?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he loved me yet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On and
on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I found some way
undreamed--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paid my
debt!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave more life and more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till all
gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He should smile--"She never
seemed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine
before.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What, she felt the while,<br>

think?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love's so different with us men!"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But they

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is her book-shelf, this her
bed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She plucked that piece
of geranium-flower,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning to die too, in the
glass:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little has yet been

through the hinge's chink.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixteen years old when she died!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps she had scarcely
heard my name;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not her time to love;
beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her life had many a hope
and aim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duties enough and little cares,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now was quiet, now

horoscope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made you of spirit,
fire, and dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just because I was thrice as

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our paths in the
world diverged so wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each was naught to each, must I be
told?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were fellow mortals,
naught beside?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, indeed! for God above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is great to grant, as
mighty to make,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And creates the love to reward the
love:<br>

taking you.<br>

meant (I shall say)<br>

pure and gay?<br>

fine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the new life come in

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lived (I shall say) so much

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was place and to spare for the
frank young smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the red young mouth,
and the hair's young gold.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So hush,--I will give you this leaf
to keep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See, I shut it inside
the sweet cold hand!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, that is our secret: go to

mad:<br>

they had,<br>

skies"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had answered, "And afterward,
what else?"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alack, it was I who leaped at the

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To E.B.B.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, September, 1855<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There they are, my fifty men and
women,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naming me the fifty poems
finished!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take them, Love, the book and me
together:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the heart lies, let the brain
lie also.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael made a century of
sonnets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made and wrote them in a certain
volume<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dinted with the silver-pointed
pencil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Else he only used to draw
Madonnas:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These, the world might view--but one,
the volume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who that one, you ask? Your heart
instructs you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she live and love it all her
lifetime?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she drop, his lady of the
sonnets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die and let it drop beside her
pillow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it lay in place of Raphael's
glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael's cheek so duteous and so
loving--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheek the world was wont to hail a
painter's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael's cheek, her love had turned
a poet's?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I would rather read that
volume<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Taken to his beating bosom by
it),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean and list the bosom-beats of
Raphael,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we not? than wonder at
Madonnas--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her, San Sisto names, and Her,
Foligno,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her, that visits Florence in a
vision,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her, that's left with lilies in the
Louvre--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen by us and all the world in
circle.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I will never read that
volume.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guido Reni like his own eye's
apple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guarded long the treasure-book and
loved it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guido Reni dying, all Bologna<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried, and the world cried too, "Ours
the treasure!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, as rare things will, it
vanished.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante once prepared to paint an
angel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom to please? You whisper
"Beatrice."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he mused and traced it and
retraced it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Peradventure with a pen corroded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still by drops of that hot ink he
dipped for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, his left hand i' the hair o'
the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back he held the brow and pricked its
stigma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bit into the live man's flesh for
parchment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loosed him, laughed to see the
writing rankle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the wretch go festering through
Florence)--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante, who loved well because he
hated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hated wickedness that hinders
loving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dante standing, studying his
angel--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In there broke the folk of his
Inferno.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he--"Certain people of
importance"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such he gave his daily dreadful line
to)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Entered and would seize, forsooth,
the poet."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says the poet--"Then I stopped my
painting."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I would rather see that
angel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Painted by the tenderness of
Dante--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would we not?--than read a fresh
Inferno.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and I will never see that
picture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he mused on love and
Beatrice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he softened o'er his outlined
angel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In they broke, those "people of
importance";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We and Bice bear the loss
forever.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What of Rafael's sonnets, Dante's
picture?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This: no artist lives and loves, that
longs not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, and only once, and for one
only,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah, the prize!) to find his love a
language<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit and fair and simple and
sufficient--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using nature that's an art to
others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not, this one time, art that's turned
his nature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, of all the artists living,
loving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None but would forego his proper
dowry.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he paint? he fain would write a
poem:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he write? he fain would paint a
picture:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put to proof art alien to the
artist's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once, and only once, and for one
only,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So to be the man and leave the
artist,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain the man's joy, miss the artist's
sorrow.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore? Heaven's gift takes
earth's abatement!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who smites the rock and spreads
the water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding drink and live a crowd
beneath him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even he the minute makes immortal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proves perchance but mortal in the
minute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desecrates belike the deed in
doing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he smites, how can he but
remember<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he smote before, in such a
peril,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they stood and mocked--"Shall
smiting help us?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they drank and sneered--"A
stroke is easy!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they wiped their mouths and went
their journey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing him for thanks--"But drought
was pleasant."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus old memories mar the actual
triumph;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus the doing savors of
disrelish;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus achievement lacks a gracious
somewhat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er-importuned brows becloud the
mandate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carelessness or consciousness--the
gesture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he bears an ancient wrong about
him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sees and knows again those phalanxed
faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hears, yet one time more, the
'customed prelude--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How shouldst thou, of all men,
smite, and save us?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guesses what is like to prove the
sequel--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Egypt's flesh-pots--nay, the drought
was better."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the crowd must have emphatic
warrant!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs the Sinai-forehead's cloven
brilliance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-arm's rod-sweep, tongue's

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never dares the man put off the

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he love one face from out the
thousands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Were she Jethro's daughter, white
and wifely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were she but the &AElig;thiopian
bondslave),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would envy yon dumb patient
camel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping a reserve of scanty water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meant to save his own life in the

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall never, in the years
remaining,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paint you pictures, no, nor carve you
statues.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make you music that should

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it seems: I stand on my

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This of verse alone, one life allows

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other heights in other lives, God
willing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the gifts from all the heights,
your own, Love!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet a semblance of resource avails
us--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shade so finely touched, love's sense
must seize it.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who works in fresco, steals a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curbs the liberal hand, subservient

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who writes may write for once as I

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, you saw me gather men and

fancy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter each and all, and use their

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hardly shall I tell my joys and
sorrows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopes and fears, belief and
disbelieving:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am mine and yours--the rest be all
men's,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Karshish, Cleon, Norbert, and the
fifty.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me speak this once in my true
person,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as Lippo, Roland, or Andrea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the fruit of speech be just
this sentence:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray you, look on these, my men and
women,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take and keep my fifty poems
finished;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where my heart lies, let my brain lie
also!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor the speech; be how I speak, for
all things.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not but that you know me! Lo, the
moon's self!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in London, yonder late in
Florence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still we find her face, the
thrice-transfigured.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curving on a sky imbrued with
color,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drifted over Fiesole by twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came she, our new crescent of a
hair's-breadth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full she flared it, lamping
Samminiato,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rounder 'twixt the cypresses and
rounder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect till the nightingales
applauded.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, a piece of her old self,
impoverished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard to greet, she traverses the
house-roofs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurries with unhandsome thrift of
silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes dispiritedly, glad to
finish.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, there's nothing in the moon
noteworthy?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay: for if that moon could love a
mortal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use to charm him (so to fit a
fancy),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her magic ('tis the old sweet
mythos).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would turn a new side to her
mortal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Side unseen of herdsman, huntsman,
steersman--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank to Zoroaster on his
terrace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blind to Galileo on his turret,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb to Homer, dumb to Keats--him,
even!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, the wonder of the moonstruck
mortal--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she turns round, comes again in
heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens out anew for worse or
better!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proves she like some portent of an
iceberg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swimming full upon the ship it
founders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hungry with huge teeth of splintered
crystals?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proves she as the paved work of a
sapphire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen by Moses when he climbed the
mountain?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbed and saw the very God, the
Highest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand upon the paved work of a
sapphire.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the bodied heaven in his
clearness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shone the stone, the sapphire of that
paved work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they ate and drank and saw God
also!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were seen? None knows, none ever
shall know.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only this is sure--the sight were
other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the moon's same side, born late
in Florence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying now impoverished here in
London.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God be thanked, the meanest of his
creatures<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boasts two soul-sides, one to face
the world with,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One to show a woman when he loves
her!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This I say of me, but think of you,
Love!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This to you--yourself my moon of
poets!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, but that's the world's side,
there's the wonder;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus they see you, praise you, think
they know you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There, in turn I stand with them and
praise you--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of my own self, I dare to phrase
it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the best is when I glide from out
them,<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cross a step or two of dubious
twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come out on the other side, the
novel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent silver lights and darks
undreamed of,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I hush and bless myself with
silence.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, their Rafael of the dear
Madonnas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, their Dante of the dread
Inferno,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrote one song--and in my brain I

<h2>ORESTES AUGUSTUS BROWNSON</h2>
<h3>(1803-1876)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>restes Brownson, in his time, was a figure of striking
originality and influence in American literature and American
political, philosophical, and religious discussion. His career was
an exceptional one; for he was connected with some of the most
important contemporaneous movements of thought, and passed through
several distinct phases: Presbyterianism, Universalism,
Socialism--of a mild and benevolent kind, not to be confused with
the later fiery and destructive socialism of "the Reds"; afterward
sympathizing somewhat with the aims and tendencies of the New
England Transcendentalists; a close intellectual associate of Ralph
Waldo Emerson; then the apostle of a "new Christianity"--finally
becoming a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/brownson.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Orestes Brownson</b></p>
<p>Coming of old Connecticut stock on his father's side, he was
born in Vermont, September 16th, 1803; and, notwithstanding that he
was brought up in poverty on a farm with small opportunity for
education, contrived in later years to make himself a thorough
scholar in various directions, mastering several languages,
acquiring a wide knowledge of history, reading deeply in
philosophy, and developing marked originality in setting forth new
philosophical views. His bent in childhood was strongly religious;
and he even believed, at that period of his life, that he held long
conversations with the sacred personages of Holy Scripture. Yet
while in manhood he devoted many years and much of his energy to
preaching, his character was aggressive and his tone controversial,
he however revealed many traits of real gentleness and humility,
and the mixture of rugged strength and tenderness in his character
and his work won him a large following in whatever position he
took.</p>
<p>He performed the remarkable feat, when the support of American
letters was slight, of founding and conducting almost
single-handed, from 1838 to 1843, his famous Quarterly Review,
which was a power in the land. He started it again in 1844 as
'Brownson's Quarterly Review,' and resumed it thirty years later in
still a third series. He died in 1876 at Detroit, much of his
active career having been passed in Boston, and some of his later
years at Seton Hall, New Jersey.</p>
<p>His various changes of belief have often been taken as an index
of vacillation; but a simple and candid study of his writings shows
that such changes were merely the normal progress of an intensely
earnest and sincere mind, which never hesitated to avow its honest
convictions nor to admit its errors. This is the quality which
gives Brownson his vitality as a mind and an author; and he will be
found to be consistent with conscience throughout.</p>
<p>His writings are forceful, eloquent, and lucid in style, with a
Websterian massiveness that does not detract from their charm. They
fill twenty volumes, divided into groups of essays on Civilization,
Controversy, Religion, Philosophy, Scientific Theories, and Popular
Literature, which cover a great and fascinating variety of topics
in detail. Brownson was an intense and patriotic American, and his
national quality comes out strongly in his extended treatise 'The
American Republic' (1865). The best known of his other works is a
candid, vigorous, and engaging autobiography entitled 'The Convert'
(1853).</p>

<h3>SAINT-SIMONISM</h3>
<center>From 'The Convert'</center>
<br>
<p>If I drew my doctrine of Union in part from the eclecticism of
Cousin, I drew my views of the Church and of the reorganization of
the race from the Saint-Simonians,--a philo-sophico-religious or a
politico-philosophical sect that sprung up in France under the
Restoration, and figured largely for a year or two under the
monarchy of July. Their founder was Claude Henri, Count de
Saint-Simon, a descendant of the Due de Saint-Simon, well known as
the author of the 'Memoirs.' He was born in 1760, entered the army
at the age of seventeen, and the year after came to this country,
where he served with distinction in our Revolutionary War under
Bouilli&eacute;. After the peace of 1783 he devoted two years to
the study of our people and institutions, and then returned to
France. Hardly had he returned before he found himself in the midst
of the French Revolution, which he regarded as the practical
application of the principles or theories adopted by the reformers
of the sixteenth century and popularized by the philosophers of the
eighteenth. He looked upon that revolution, we are told, as having
only a destructive mission--necessary, important, but inadequate to
the wants of humanity; and instead of being carried away by it as
were most of the young men of his age and his principles, he set
himself at work to amass materials for the erection of a new social
edifice on the ruins of the old, which should stand and improve in
solidity, strength, grandeur, and beauty forever.</p>
<p>The way he seems to have taken to amass these materials was to
engage with a partner in some grand speculations for the
accumulation of wealth,--and speculations too, it is said, not of
the most honorable or even the most honest character. His plans
succeeded for a time, and he became very rich, as did many others
in those troublous times; but he finally met with reverses, and
lost all but the wrecks of his fortune. He then for a number of
years plunged into all manner of vice, and indulged to excess in
every species of dissipation; not, we are told, from love of vice,
any inordinate desire, or any impure affection, but for the holy
purpose of preparing himself by his experience for the great work
of redeeming man and securing for him a Paradise on earth. Having
gained all that experience could give him in the department of
vice, he then proceeded to consult the learned professors of
L'&Eacute;cole Polytechnique for seven or ten years, to make
himself master of science, literature, and the fine arts in all
their departments, and to place himself at the level of the last
attainments of the race. Thus qualified to be the founder of a new
social organization, he wrote several books, in which he deposited
the germs of his ideas, or rather the germs of the future; most of
which have hitherto remained unpublished.</p>
<p>But now that he was so well qualified for his work he found
himself a beggar, and had as yet made only a single disciple. He
was reduced to despair and attempted to take his own life; but
failed, the ball only grazing his sacred forehead. His faithful
disciple was near him, saved him, and aroused him into life and
hope. When he recovered he found that he had fallen into a gross
error. He had been a materialist, an atheist, and had discarded all
religious ideas as long since outgrown by the human race. He had
proposed to organize the human race with materials furnished by the
senses alone, and by the aid of positive science. He owns his
fault, and conceives and brings forth a new Christianity, consigned
to a small pamphlet entitled 'Nouveau Christianisme,' which was
immediately published. This done, his mission was ended, and he
died May 19th, 1825, and I suppose was buried.</p>
<p>Saint-Simon, the preacher of a new Christianity, very soon
attracted disciples, chiefly from the pupils of the Polytechnic
School; ardent and lively young men, full of enthusiasm, brought up
without faith in the gospel and yet unable to live without religion
of some sort. Among the active members of the sect were at one time
Pierre Leroux, Jules and Michel Chevalier, Lerminier, [and] my
personal friend Dr. Poyen, who initiated me and so many others in
New England into the mysteries of animal magnetism. Dr. Poyen was,
I believe, a native of the island of Guadeloupe: a man of more
ability than he usually had credit for, of solid learning, genuine
science, and honest intentions. I knew him well and esteemed him
highly. When I knew him his attachment to the new religion was much
weakened, and he often talked to me of the old Church, and assured
me that he felt at times that he must return to her bosom. I owe
him many hints which turned my thoughts toward Catholic principles,
and which, with God's grace, were of much service to me. These and
many others were in the sect; whose chiefs, after the death of its
founder, were--Bazard, a Liberal and a practical man, who killed
himself; and Enfantin, who after the dissolution of the sect sought
employment in the service of the Viceroy of Egypt, and occupies now
some important post in connection with the French railways.</p>
<p>The sect began in 1826 by addressing the working classes; but
their success was small. In 1829 they came out of their narrow
circle, assumed a bolder tone, addressed themselves to the general
public, and became in less than eighteen months a Parisian
<i>mode</i>. In 1831 they purchased the Globe newspaper, made it
their organ, and distributed gratuitously five thousand copies
daily. In 1832 they had established a central propagandism in
Paris, and had their missionaries in most of the departments of
France. They attacked the hereditary peerage, and it fell; they
seemed to be numerous and strong, and I believed for a moment in
their complete success. They called their doctrine a religion,
their ministers priests, and their organization a church; and as
such they claimed to be recognized by the State, and to receive
from it a subvention as other religious denominations [did]. But
the courts decided that Saint-Simonism was not a religion and its
ministers were not religious teachers. This decision struck them
with death. Their prestige vanished. They scattered, dissolved in
thin air, and went off, as Carlyle would say, into endless vacuity,
as do sooner or later all shams and unrealities.</p>
<p>Saint-Simon himself, who as presented to us by his disciples is
a half-mythic personage, seems, so far as I can judge by those of
his writings that I have seen, to have been a man of large ability
and laudable intentions; but I have not been able to find any new
or original thoughts of which he was the indisputable father. His
whole system, if system he had, is summed up in the two maxims
"Eden is before us, not behind us" (or the Golden Age of the poets
is in the future, not in the past), and "Society ought to be so
organized as to tend in the most rapid manner possible to the
continuous moral, intellectual, and physical amelioration of the
poorer and more numerous classes." He simply adopts the doctrine of
progress set forth with so much flash eloquence by Condorcet, and
the philanthropic doctrine with regard to the laboring classes, or
the people, defended by Barbeuf and a large section of the French
Revolutionists. His religion was not so much as the
Theophilanthropy attempted to be introduced by some members of the
French Directory: it admitted God in name, and in name did not deny
Jesus Christ, but it rejected all mysteries, and reduced religion
to mere socialism. It conceded that Catholicity had been the true
Church down to the pontificate of Leo X., because down to that time
its ministers had taken the lead in directing the intelligence and
labors of mankind, had aided the progress of civilization, and
promoted the well-being of the poorer and more numerous classes.
But since Leo X., who made of the Papacy a secular principality, it
had neglected its mission, had ceased to labor for the poorer and
more numerous classes, had leagued itself with the ruling orders,
and lent all its influence to uphold tyrants and tyranny. A new
church was needed; a church which should realize the ideal of Jesus
Christ, and tend directly and constantly to the moral, physical,
and social amelioration of the poorer and more numerous
classes,--in other words, the greatest happiness in this life of
the greatest number, the principle of Jeremy Bentham and his
Utilitarian school.</p>
<p>His disciples enlarged upon the hints of the master, and
attributed to him ideas which he never entertained. They endeavored
to reduce his hints to a complete system of religion, philosophy,
and social organization. Their chiefs, I have said, were Amand
Bazard and Barth&eacute;lemy Prosper Enfantin....</p>
<p>Bazard took the lead in what related to the external, political,
and economical organization, and Enfantin in what regarded doctrine
and worship. The philosophy or theology of the sect or school was
derived principally from Hegel, and was a refined Pantheism. Its
Christology was the unity, not union, of the divine and human; and
the Incarnation symbolized the unity of God and man, or the
Divinity manifesting himself in humanity, and making humanity
substantially divine,--the very doctrine in reality which I myself
had embraced even before I had heard of the Saint-Simonians, if not
before they had published it. The religious organization was
founded on the doctrine of the progressive nature of man, and the
maxim that all institutions should tend in the most speedy and
direct manner possible to the constant amelioration of the moral,
intellectual, and physical condition of the poorer and more
numerous classes. Socially men were to be divided into three
classes,--artists, <i>savans</i>, and industrials or working men,
corresponding to the psychological division of the human faculties.
The soul has three powers or faculties,--to love, to know, and to
act. Those in whom the love-faculty is predominant belong to the
class of artists, those in whom the knowledge-faculty is
predominant belong to the class of <i>savans</i>, the scientific
and the learned, and in fine, those in whom the act-faculty
predominates belong to the industrial class. This classification
places every man in the social category for which he is fitted, and
to which he is attracted by his nature. These several classes are
to be hierarchically organized under chiefs or priests, who are
respectively priests of the artists, of the scientific, and of the
industrials, and are, priests and all, to be subjected to a supreme
Father, <i>P&egrave;re Supr&eacute;me</i>, and a Supreme Mother,
<i>M&egrave;re Supr&eacute;me</i>.</p>
<p>The economical organization is to be based on the maxims, "To
each one according to his capacity," and "To each capacity
according to its work." Private property is to be retained, but its
transmission by inheritance or testamentary disposition must be
abolished. The property is to be held by a tenure resembling that
of gavel-kind. It belongs to the community, and the priests,
chiefs, or brehons, as the Celtic tribes call them, to distribute
it for life to individuals, and to each individual according to his
capacity. It was supposed that in this way the advantages of both
common and individual property might be secured. Something of this
prevailed originally in most nations, and a reminiscence of it
still exists in the village system among the Slavonic tribes of
Russia and Poland; and nearly all jurists maintain that the
testamentary right by which a man disposes of his goods after his
natural death, as well as that by which a child inherits from the
parent, is a municipal, not a natural right.</p>
<p>The most striking feature in the Saint-Simonian scheme was the
rank and position it assigned to woman. It asserted the absolute
equality of the sexes, and maintained that either sex is incomplete
without the other. Man is an incomplete individual without woman.
Hence a religion, a doctrine, a social institution founded by one
sex alone is incomplete, and can never be adequate to the wants of
the race or a definite order. This idea was also entertained by
Frances Wright, and appears to be entertained by all our Women's
Rights folk of either sex. The old civilization was masculine, not
male and female as God made man. Hence its condemnation. The
Saint-Simonians, therefore, proposed to place by the side of their
sovereign Father at the summit of their hierarchy a sovereign
Mother. The man to be sovereign Father they found; but a woman to
be sovereign Mother, <i>M&egrave;re Supr&ecirc;me</i>, they found
not. This caused great embarrassment, and a split between Bazard
and Enfantin. Bazard was about marrying his daughter, and he
proposed to place her marriage under the protection of the existing
French laws. Enfantin opposed his doing so, and called it a sinful
compliance with the prejudices of the world. The Saint-Simonian
society, he maintained, was a State, a kingdom within itself, and
should be governed by its own laws and its own chiefs without any
recognition of those without. Bazard persisted, and had the
marriage of his daughter solemnized in a legal manner, and for
aught I know, according to the rites of the Church. A great scandal
followed. Bazard charged Enfantin with denying Christian marriage,
and with holding loose notions on the subject. Enfantin replied
that he neither denied nor affirmed Christian marriage; that in
enacting the existing law on the subject man alone had been
consulted, and he could not recognize it as law till woman had
given her consent to it. As yet the society was only provisionally
organized, inasmuch as they had not yet found the <i>M&egrave;re
Supr&ecirc;me</i>. The law on marriage must emanate conjointly from
the Supreme Father and the Supreme Mother, and it would be
irregular and a usurpation for the Supreme Father to undertake
alone to legislate on the subject. Bazard would not submit, and
went out and shot himself. Most of the politicians abandoned the
association; and P&egrave;re Enfantin, almost in despair,
dispatched twelve apostles to Constantinople to find in the Turkish
harems the Supreme Mother. After a year they returned and reported
that they were unable to find her; and the society, condemned by
the French courts as immoral, broke up, and broke up because no
woman could be found to be its mother. And so they ended, having
risen, flourished, and decayed in less than a single decade.</p>
<p>The points in the Saint-Simonian movement that arrested my
attention and commanded my belief were what it will seem strange to
my readers could ever have been doubted,--its assertion of a
religious future for the human race, and that religion, in the
future as well as in the past, must have an organization, and a
hierarchical organization. Its classification of men according to
the predominant psychological faculty in each, into artists,
savans, and industrials, struck me as very well; and the maxims "To
each according to his capacity," and "To each capacity according to
its works," as evidently just, and desirable if practicable. The
doctrine of the Divinity in Humanity, of progress, of no essential
antagonism between the spiritual and the material, and of the duty
of shaping all institutions for the speediest and continuous moral,
intellectual, and physical amelioration of the poorer and more
numerous classes, I already held. I was rather pleased than
otherwise with the doctrine with regard to property, and thought it
a decided improvement on that of a community of goods. The doctrine
with regard to the relation of the sexes I rather acquiesced in
than approved. I was disposed to maintain, as the Indian said, that
"woman is the weaker canoe," and to assert my marital prerogatives;
but the equality of the sexes was asserted by nearly all my
friends, and I remained generally silent on the subject, till some
of the admirers of Harriet Martineau and Margaret Fuller began to
scorn equality and to claim for woman superiority. Then I became
roused, and ventured to assert my masculine dignity.</p>
<p>It is remarkable that most reformers find fault with the
Christian law of marriage, and propose to alter the relations which
God has established both in nature and the gospel between the
sexes; and this is generally the rock on which they split. Women do
not usually admire men who cast off their manhood or are
unconscious of the rights and prerogatives of the stronger sex; and
they admire just as little those "strong-minded women" who strive
to excel only in the masculine virtues. I have never been persuaded
that it argues well for a people when its women are men and its men
women. Yet I trust I have always honored and always shall honor
woman. I raise no question as to woman's equality or inequality
with man, for comparisons cannot be made between things not of the
same kind. Woman's sphere and office in life are as high, as holy,
as important as man's, but different; and the glory of both man and
woman is for each to act well the part assigned to each by Almighty
God.</p>
<p>The Saint-Simonian writings made me familiar with the idea of a
hierarchy, and removed from my mind the prejudices against the
Papacy generally entertained by my countrymen. Their proposed
organization, I saw, might be good and desirable if their priests,
their Supreme Father and Mother, could really be the wisest, the
best,--not merely the nominal but the real chiefs of society. Yet
what security have I that they will be? Their power was to have no
limit save their own wisdom and love, but who would answer for it
that these would always be an effectual limit? How were these
priests or chiefs to be designated and installed in their office?
By popular election? But popular election often passes over the
proper man and takes the improper. Then as to the assignment to
each man of a capital proportioned to his capacity to begin life
with, what certainty is there that the rules of strict right will
be followed? that wrong will not often be done, both voluntarily
and involuntarily? Are your chiefs to be infallible and impeccable?
Still the movement interested me, and many of its principles took
firm hold of me and held me for years in a species of mental
thraldom; insomuch that I found it difficult, if not impossible,
either to refute them or to harmonize them with other principles
which I also held, or rather which held me, and in which I detected
no unsoundness. Yet I imbibed no errors from the Saint-Simonians;
and I can say of them as of the Unitarians,--they did me no harm,
but were in my fallen state the occasion of much good to me.</p>

<h2>FERDINAND BRUNETI&Egrave;RE</h2>
<h3>(1849-)</h3>
<center>BY ADOLPHE COHN</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-f.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>erdinand Bruneti&egrave;re, the celebrated French literary
critic, was born in Toulon, the great military Mediterranean
sea-port of France, in the year 1849. His studies were begun in the
college of his native city and continued in Paris, in the
Lyc&eacute;e Louis le Grand, where in the class of philosophy he
came under Professor &Eacute;mile Charles, by whose original and
profound though decidedly sad way of thinking he was powerfully
influenced. His own ambition then was to become a teacher in the
University of France, an ambition which seemed unlikely to be ever
realized, as he failed to secure admission to the celebrated
&Eacute;cole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure, in the competitive
examination which leads up to that school. Strangely enough, about
fifteen years later he was, though not in possession of any very
high University degree, appointed to the Professorship of French
Literature in the school which he had been unable to enter as a
scholar, and his appointment received the hearty indorsement of all
the leading educational authorities in France.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/brunetiere.jpg" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Ferdiand Bruneti&egrave;re</b></p>
<p>For several years after leaving the Lyc&eacute;e Louis le Grand,
while completing his literary outfit by wonderfully extensive
reading, Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re lived on stray orders for work
for publishers. He seldom succeeded in getting these, and when he
got any they were seldom filled. Thus he happened to be
commissioned by the firm of Germer, Bailli&egrave;re and Company to
write a history of Russia, which never was and to all appearances
never will be written. The event which determined the direction of
his career was the acceptance by the Revue des Deux Mondes, in
1875, of an article upon contemporary French novelists.
Fran&ccedil;ois Buloz, the energetic and imperious founder and
editor of the world-famed French bi-monthly, felt that he had found
in the young critic the man whom French literary circles had been
waiting for, and who was to be Sainte-Beuve's successor; and
Fran&ccedil;ois Buloz was a man who seldom made mistakes.</p>
<p>French literary criticism was just then at a very low ebb.
Sainte-Beuve had been dead about five years; his own
contemporaries, Edmond Sch&eacute;rer for instance, were getting
old and discouraged; the new generation seemed to be turning
unanimously, in consequence of the disasters of the Franco-German
war and of the Revolution of September, 1870, to military or
political activity. The only form of literature which had power to
attract young writers was the novel, which they could fill with the
description of all the passions then agitating the public mind.
That a man of real intellectual strength should then give his
undivided attention to pure literature seemed a most unlikely
phenomenon; but all had to acknowledge that the unlikely had
happened, soon after Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re had become the
regular literary critic of the Revue des Deux Mondes.</p>
<p>Fortunately the new critic did not undertake to walk in the
footsteps of Sainte-Beuve. In the art of presenting to the reader
the marrow of a writer's work, of making the writer himself known
by the description of his surroundings, the narrative of his life,
the study of the forces by which he was influenced, the illustrious
author of the 'Causeries du Lundi' remains to this day without a
rival or a continuator. Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re had a different
conception of the duties of a literary critic. The one fault with
which thoughtful readers were apt to charge Sainte-Beuve was, that
he failed to pass judgment upon the works and writers; and this
failure was often, and not altogether unjustly, ascribed to a
certain weakness in his grasp of principles, a certain
faint-heartedness whenever it became necessary to take sides. Any
one who studies Bruneti&egrave;re can easily see that from the
start his chief concern was to make it impossible for any one to
charge him with the same fault. He came in with a set of principles
which he has since upheld with remarkable steadfastness and
courage. In an age when nearly every one was turning to the future
and advocating the doctrine and the necessity of progress, when the
chief fear of most men was that they should appear too much afraid
of change, Bruneti&egrave;re proclaimed time and again that there
was no safety for any nation or set of men except in a staunch
adherence to tradition. He bade his readers turn their minds away
from the current literature of the day, and take hold of the
exemplars of excellence handed down to us by the great men of the
past. Together with tradition he upheld authority, and therefore
preferred to all others the period in which French literature and
society had most willingly submitted to authority, that is, the
seventeenth century and the reign of Louis XIV. When compelled to
speak of the literature of the day, he did it in no uncertain
tones. His book 'The Naturalistic Novel' consists of a series of
articles in which he studies Zola and his school, upholding the old
doctrine that there are things in life which must be kept out of
the domain of art and cannot be therein introduced without lowering
the ideal of man. Between the naturalistic and the idealistic novel
he unhesitatingly declares for the latter, and places George Sand
far above the author of 'L'Assommoir.'</p>
<p>But the great success of his labors cannot be said to have been
due solely or even mainly to the principles he advocated. Other
critics have appeared since--Messrs. Jules Lema&icirc;tre and
Anatole France, for instance,--who antagonize almost everything
that he defends and defend almost everything that he antagonizes,
and whose success has hardly been inferior to his. Neither is it
due to any charm in his style. Bruneti&egrave;re's sentences are
compact,--indeed, strongly knit together,--but decidedly heavy and
at times even clumsy. What he has to say he always says strongly,
but not gracefully. He has a remarkable appreciation of the value
of the words of the French language, but his arrangement of them is
seldom free from mannerisms. What, then, has made him the foremost
literary critic of the present day? The answer is, knowledge and
sincerity. No writer of the present day, save perhaps Anatole
France, is so accurately informed of every fact that bears upon
literary history. Every argument he brings forward is supported by
an array of incontrovertible facts that is simply appalling. No one
can argue with him who does not first subject himself to the
severest kind of training, go through a mass of tedious reading,
become familiar with dates to the point of handling them as nimbly
as a bank clerk handles the figures of a check list. And all this
comes forward in Bruneti&egrave;re's articles in the most natural,
we had almost said casual way. The fact takes its place unheralded
in the reasoning. It is there because it has to be there, not
because the writer wishes to make a display of his wonderful
knowledge; and thus it happens that Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re's
literary articles are perhaps the most instructive ones ever
written in the French language. They are moreover admirably
trustworthy. It would never come to this author's mind to hide a
fact that goes against any of his theories. He feels so sure of
being in the right that he is always willing to give his opponents
all that they can possibly claim.</p>
<p>Of late years, moreover, it must be acknowledged that
Bruneti&egrave;re's mind has given signs of remarkable broadening.
Under the influence of the doctrine of evolution, he has undertaken
to class all literary facts as the great naturalists of the day
have classed the facts of physiology, and to show that literary
forms spring from each other by way of transformation in the same
way as do the forms of animal or vegetable life. Already three
works have been produced by him since he entered upon this new line
of development: a history of literary criticism in France, which
forms the first and hitherto only published volume of a large work,
(The Evolution of Literary Forms); a work on the French drama, (The
Periods of the French Theatre); and a treatise on modern French
poetry, (The Evolution of French Lyric Poetry during the Nineteenth
Century.) The second and last of these were first delivered by
their author from the professor's chair or the lecturer's platform,
where he has managed to display some of the greatest gifts of the
public speaker. Most of M. Bruneti&egrave;re's literary articles
have been collected in book form under the following
titles:--(Questions of Criticism) (2 vols.), (History and
Criticism) (3 vols.), (Critical Studies on the History of French
Literature) (6 vols.), (The Naturalistic Novel) (1 vol.).</p>
<p>At various times remarkable addresses have been delivered by him
on public occasions, in which he has often represented the French
Academy since his election to that illustrious body. Unfortunately
his productive literary activity has slackened of late. In 1895 he
was called to the editorship of the Revue des Deux Mondes, and
since his assumption of this responsible editorial position he has
published only two or three articles, bearing upon moral and
educational questions.</p>
<p>To pass final judgment upon a man whose development is far from
completed is an almost impossible task. Still it may be said that
with the exception of Sainte-Beuve's (Causeries du Lundi) and
(Nouveaux Lundis,) nothing exists that can teach the reader so much
about the history of French literature as Bruneti&egrave;re's
works. The doctrinal side, to which the author himself undoubtedly
attaches the greatest importance, will strike the reader as often
very questionable. Too often Bruneti&egrave;re seems in his
judgments to be quite unconsciously actuated by a dislike of the
accepted opinion of the present day. His love of the past bears a
look of defiance of the present, not calculated to win the reader's
assent. But even this does not go without its good side. It gives
to Bruneti&egrave;re's judgments a unity which is seldom if ever
found in the works of those whose chief labors have been spent in
the often ungrateful task of making a hurried public acquainted
with the uninterrupted stream of literary production.</p>

<h3>TAINE AND PRINCE NAPOLEON</h3>
<br>
<p>For the last five or six months, since it has been known that a
prince, nephew, cousin, and son of emperors or kings formerly very
powerful, had proposed to answer the libel, as he calls it, written
by M. Taine about Napoleon, we have been awaiting this reply with
an impatience, a curiosity which were equally justified,--although
for very different reasons,--by M. Taine's reputation, by the
glorious name of his antagonist, by the greatness, and finally the
national interest of the subject.</p>
<p>The book has just appeared; and if we can say without flattery
that it has revealed to us in the Prince a writer whose existence
we had not suspected, it is because we must at once add that
neither in its manner nor in its matter is the book itself what it
might have been. Prince Napoleon did not wish to write a 'Life of
Napoleon,' and nobody expected that of him,--for after all, and for
twenty different reasons, even had he wished it he could not have
done it. But to M. Taine's Napoleon, since he did not find in him
the true Napoleon, since he declared him to be as much against
nature as against history, he could, and we expected that he would,
have opposed his own Napoleon. By the side of the "inventions of a
writer whose judgment had been misled and whose conscience had been
obscured by passion,"--these are his own words,--he could have
restored, as he promised in his 'Introduction,' "the man and his
work in their living reality." And in our imaginations, on which M.
Taine's harsh and morose workmanship had engraven the features of a
modern Malatesta or modern Sforza, <i>he</i> could at last
substitute for them, as the inheritor of the name and the dynastic
claims, the image of the founder of contemporary France, of the god
of war. Unfortunately, instead of doing so, it is M. Taine himself,
it is his analytical method, it is the witnesses whom M. Taine
chose as his authorities, that Prince Napoleon preferred to assail,
as a scholar in an Academy who descants upon the importance of the
genuineness of a text, and moreover with a freedom of utterance and
a pertness of expression which on any occasion I should venture to
pronounce decidedly insulting.</p>
<p>For it is a misfortune of princes, when they do us the honor of
discussing with us, that they must observe a moderation, a reserve,
a courtesy greater even than our own. It will therefore be
unanimously thought that it ill became Prince Napoleon to address
M. Taine in a tone which M. Taine would decline to use in his
answer, out of respect for the very name which he is accused of
<i>slandering</i>. It will be thought also that it ill became him,
when speaking of Miot de Melito, for instance, or of many other
servants of the imperial government, to seem to ignore that princes
also are under an obligation to those who have served them well.
Perhaps even it may be thought that it poorly became him, when
discussing or contradicting the 'Memoirs of Madame de
R&eacute;musat,' to forget under what auspices the remains of his
uncle, the Emperor, were years ago carried in his city of Paris.
But what will be thought especially is, that he had something else
to do than to split hairs in discussion of evidences; that he had
something far better to say, more peremptory and to the point, and
more literary besides, than to call M. Taine names, to hurl at him
the epithets of "Entomologist, Materialist, Pessimist, Destroyer of
Reputations, Iconoclast," and to class him as a
"d&eacute;boulonneur" among those who, in 1871, pulled down the
Colonne Vend&ocirc;me.</p>
<p>Not, undoubtedly, that M. Taine--and we said so ourselves more
than once with perfect freedom--if spending much patience and
conscientiousness in his search for documents, has always displayed
as much critical spirit and discrimination in the use he made of
them. We cannot understand why in his 'Napoleon' he accepted the
testimony of Bourrienne, for instance, any more than recently, in
his 'Revolution,' that of George Duval, or again, in his 'Ancien
R&eacute;gime,' that of the notorious Soulavic. M. Taine's
documents as a rule are not used by him as a foundation for his
argument; no, he first takes his position, and then he consults his
library, or he goes to the original records, with the hope of
finding those documents that will support his reasoning. But
granting that, we must own that though different from M. Taine's,
Prince Napoleon's historical method is not much better; that though
in a different manner and in a different direction, it is neither
less partial nor less passionate: and here is a proof of it.</p>
<p>Prince Napoleon blames M. Taine for quoting "eight times"
'Bourrienne's Memoirs,' and then, letting his feelings loose, he
takes advantage of the occasion and cruelly besmirches Bourrienne's
name. Does he tell the truth or not? is he right at the bottom? I
do not know anything about it; I do not <i>wish</i> to know
anything; I do not need it, since I <i>know</i>, from other
sources, that 'Bourrienne's Memoirs' are hardly less spurious than,
say, the 'Souvenirs of the Marquise de Cr&eacute;qui' or the
'Memoirs of Monsieur d'Artagnan.' But if these so-called 'Memoirs'
are really not his, what has Bourrienne himself to do here? and
suppose the former secretary of the First Consul to have been,
instead of the shameless embezzler whom Prince Napoleon so fully
and so uselessly describes to us, the most honest man in the world,
would the 'Memoirs' be any more reliable, since it is a fact that
<i>he</i> wrote nothing? ...</p>
<p>And now I cannot but wonder at the tone in which those who
contradict M. Taine, and especially Prince Napoleon himself,
condescend to tell him that he lacks that which would be needed in
order to speak of Napoleon or the Revolution. But who is it, then,
that <i>has</i> what is needed in order to judge Napoleon?
Frederick the Great, or Catherine II., perhaps,--as Napoleon
himself desired, "his peers"; or in other words, those who, born as
he was for war and government, can only admire, justify, and
glorify themselves in him. And who will judge the Revolution?
Danton. we suppose, or Robespierre,--that is, the men who were the
Revolution itself. No: the real judge will be the average opinion
of men; the force that will create, modify, correct this average
opinion, the historians will be; and among the historians of our
time, in spite of Prince Napoleon, it will be M. Taine for a large
share.</p>

<h3>THE LITERATURES OF FRANCE, ENGLAND, AND GERMANY</h3>
<br>
<p>Twice at least in the course of their long history, it is known
that the literature and even the language of France has exerted
over the whole of Europe an influence, whose universal character
other languages perhaps more harmonious,--Italian for
instance,--and other literatures more original in certain respects,
like English literature, have never possessed. It is in a purely
French form that our medi&aelig;val poems, our 'Chansons de Geste,'
our 'Romances of the Round Table,' our <i>fabliaux</i> themselves,
whencesoever they came,--Germany or Tuscany, England or Brittany,
Asia or Greece,--conquered, fascinated, charmed, from one end of
Europe to the other, the imaginations of the Middle Ages. The
amorous languor and the subtlety of our "courteous poetry" are
breathed no less by the madrigals of Shakespeare himself than by
Petrarch's sonnets; and after such a long lapse of time we still
discover something that comes from us even in the Wagnerian drama,
for instance in 'Parsifal' or in 'Tristan and Isolde.' A long time
later, in a Europe belonging entirely to classicism, from the
beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century,
during one hundred and fifty years or even longer, French
literature possessed a real sovereignty in Italy, in Spain, in
England, and in Germany. Do not the names of Algarotti, Bettinelli,
Beccaria, Filengieri, almost belong to France? What shall I say of
the famous Gottschedt? Shall I recall the fact that in his
victorious struggle against Voltaire, Lessing had to call in
Diderot's assistance? And who ignores that if Rivarol wrote his
'Discourse upon the Universality of the French Language,' it can be
charged neither to his vanity nor to our national vanity, since he
was himself half Italian, and the subject had been proposed by the
Academy of Berlin?</p>
<p>All sorts of reasons have been given for this universality of
French literature: some were statistical, if I may say so, some
geographical, political, linguistic. But the true one, the good
one, is different: it must be found in the supremely sociable
character of the literature itself. If at that time our great
writers were understood and appreciated by everybody, it is because
they were addressing everybody, or better, because they were
speaking to all concerning the interests of all. They were
attracted neither by exceptions nor by peculiarities: they cared to
treat only of man in general, or as is also said, of the universal
man, restrained by the ties of human society; and their very
success shows that below all that distinguishes, say, an Italian
from a German, this universal man whose reality has so often been
discussed, persists and lives, and though constantly changing never
loses his own likeness....</p>
<p>In comparison with the literature of France, thus defined and
characterized by its sociable spirit, the literature of England is
an individualistic literature. Let us put aside, as should be done,
the generation of Congreve and Wycherley, perhaps also the
generation of Pope and Addison,--to which, however, we ought not to
forget that Swift also belonged;--it seems that an Englishman never
writes except in order to give to himself the external sensation of
his own personality. Thence his <i>humor</i>, which may be defined
as the expression of the pleasure he feels in thinking like nobody
else. Thence, in England, the plenteousness, the wealth, the
amplitude of the lyric vein; it being granted that
<i>individualism</i> is the very spring of lyric poetry, and that
an ode or an elegy is, as it were, the involuntary surging, the
outflowing of what is most intimate, most secret, most peculiar in
the poet's soul. Thence also the <i>eccentricity</i> of all the
great English writers when compared with the rest of the nation, as
though they became conscious of themselves only by distinguishing
themselves from those who claim to differ from them least. But is
it not possible to otherwise characterize the literature of
England? It will be easily conceived that I dare not assert such a
thing; all I say here is, that I cannot better express the
differences which distinguish that literature from our own.</p>
<p>That is also all I claim, in stating that the essential
character of the literature of Germany is, that it is
<i>philosophical</i>. The philosophers there are poets, and the
poets are philosophers. Goethe is to be found no more, or no less,
in his 'Theory of Colors' or in his 'Metamorphosis of Plants,' than
in his 'Divan' or his 'Faust'; and lyrism, if I may use this trite
expression, "is overflowing" in Schleiermacher's theology and in
Schelling's philosophy. Is this not perhaps at least one of the
reasons of the inferiority of the German drama? It is surely the
reason of the depth and scope of Germanic poetry. Even in the
masterpieces of German literature it seems that there is mixed
something indistinct, or rather mysterious, <i>suggestive</i> in
the extreme, which leads us to thought by the channel of the dream.
But who has not been struck by what, under a barbarous terminology,
there is of attractive, and as such of eminently poetical, of
realistic and at the same time idealistic, in the great systems of
Kant and Fichte, Hegel and Schopenhauer? Assuredly nothing is
further removed from the character of our French literature. We can
here understand what the Germans mean when they charge us with a
lack of depth. Let them forgive us if <i>we</i> do not blame their
literature for not being the same as ours.</p>
<p>For it is good that it be thus, and for five or six hundred
years this it is that has made the greatness not only of European
literature, but of Western civilization itself; I mean that which
all the great nations, after slowly elaborating it, as it were, in
their national isolation, have afterwards deposited in the common
treasury of the human race. Thus, to this one we owe the sense of
mystery, and we might say the revelation of what is beautiful, in
that which remains obscure and cannot be grasped. To another we owe
the sense of art, and what may be called the appreciation of the
power of form. A third one has handed to us what was most heroic in
the conception of chivalrous honor. And to another, finally, we owe
it that we know what is both most ferocious and noblest, most
wholesome and most to be feared, in human pride. The share that
belongs to us Frenchmen was, in the meanwhile, to bind, to fuse
together, and as it were to unify under the idea of the general
society of mankind, the contradictory and even hostile elements
that may have existed in all that. No matter whether our inventions
and ideas were, by their origin, Latin or Romance, Celtic or
Gallic, Germanic even, if you please, the whole of Europe had
borrowed them from us in order to adapt them to the genius of its
different races. Before re-admitting them in our turn, before
adopting them after they had been thus transformed, we asked only
that they should be able to serve the progress of reason and of
humanity. What was troublous in them we clarified; what was
corrupting we corrected; what was local we generalized; what was
excessive we brought down to the proportions of mankind. Have we
not sometimes also lessened their grandeur and altered their
purity? If Corneille has undoubtedly brought nearer to us the still
somewhat barbaric heroes of Guillem de Castro, La Fontaine, when
imitating the author of the Decameron, has made him more indecent
than he is in his own language; and if the Italians have no right
to assail Moli&egrave;re for borrowing somewhat from them, the
English may well complain that Voltaire failed to understand
Shakespeare. But it is true none the less that in disengaging from
the particular man of the North or the South this idea of a
universal man, for which we have been so often reviled,--if any one
of the modern literatures has breathed in its entirety the spirit
of the public weal and of civilization, it is the literature of
France. And this ideal cannot possibly be as empty as has too often
been asserted; since, as I endeavored to show, from Lisbon to
Stockholm and from Archangel to Naples, it is its manifestations
that foreigners have loved to come across in the masterpieces, or
better, in the whole sequence of the history of our literature.</p>

<h2>GIORDANO BRUNO</h2>
<h3>(1548-1600)</h3>
<br>

<p>illippo Bruno, known as Giordano Bruno, was born at Nola, near
Naples, in 1548. This was eight years after the death of
Copernicus, whose system he eagerly espoused, and ten years before
the birth of Bacon, with whom he associated in England. Of an
ardent, poetic temperament, he entered the Dominican order in
Naples at the early age of sixteen, doubtless attracted to
conventual life by the opportunities of study it offered to an
eager intellect. Bruno had been in the monastery nearly thirteen
years when he was accused of heresy in attacking some of the dogmas
of the Church. He fled first to Rome and then to Northern Italy,
where he wandered about for three seasons from city to city,
teaching and writing. In 1579 he arrived at Geneva, then the
stronghold of the Calvinists. Coming into conflict with the
authorities there on account of his religious opinions, he was
thrown into prison. He escaped and went to Toulouse, at that time
the literary centre of Southern France, where he lectured for a
year on Aristotle. His restless spirit, however, drove him on to
Paris. Here he was made professor extraordinary at the
Sorbonne.</p>
<p>Although his teachings were almost directly opposed to the
philosophic tenets of the time, attacking the current dogmas, and
Aristotle, the idol of the schoolmen, yet such was the power of
Bruno's eloquence and the charm of his manner that crowds flocked
to his lecture-room, and he became one of the most popular foreign
teachers the university had known. Under pretense of expounding the
writings of Thomas Aquinas, he set forth his own philosophy. He
also spoke much on the art of memory, amplifying the writings of
Raymond Lully; and these principles, formulated by the monk of the
thirteenth century and taken up again by the free-thinkers of the
sixteenth, are the basis of all the present-day mnemonics.</p>
<p>But Bruno went even further. He attracted the attention of King
Henry III. of France, who in 1583 introduced him to the French
ambassador to England, Castelnuovo di Manvissi&egrave;re. Going to
London, he spent three years in the family of this nobleman, more
as friend than dependent. They were the happiest, or at least the
most restful years of his stormy life. England was just then
entering on the glorious epoch of her Elizabethan literature. Bruno
came into the brilliant court circles, meeting even the Queen, who
cordially welcomed all men of culture, especially the Italians. The
astute monk reciprocated her good-will by paying her the customary
tribute of flattery. He won the friendship of Sir Philip Sidney, to
whom he dedicated two of his books, and enjoyed the acquaintance of
Spenser, Sir Fulke Greville, Dyer, Harvey, Sir William Temple,
Bacon, and other wits and poets of the day.</p>
<p>At that time--somewhere about 1580--Shakespeare was still
serving his apprenticeship as playwright, and had perhaps less
claim on the notice of the observant foreigner than his elder
contemporaries. London was still a small town, where the news of
the day spread rapidly, and where, no doubt, strangers were as
eagerly discussed as they are now within narrow town limits.
Bruno's daring speculations could not remain the exclusive property
of his own coterie. And as Shakespeare had the faculty of absorbing
all new ideas afloat in the air, he would hardly have escaped the
influence of the teacher who proclaimed in proud self-confidence
that he was come to arouse men out of their theological stagnation.
His influence on Bacon is more evident, because of their friendly
associations. Bruno lectured at Oxford, but the English university
found less favor in his eyes than English court life. Pedantry had
indeed set its fatal mark on scholarship, not only on the Continent
but in England. Aristotle was still the god of the pedants of that
age, and dissent from his teaching was heavily punished, for the
dry dust of learning blinded the eyes of the scholastics to new
truths.</p>
<p>Bruno, the knight-errant of these truths, devoted all his life
to scourging pedantry, and dissented <i>in toto</i> from the idol
of the schools. No wonder he and Oxford did not agree together. He
wittily calls her "the widow of sound learning," and again, "a
constellation of pedantic, obstinate ignorance and presumption,
mixed with a clownish incivility that would tax the patience of
Job." He lashed the shortcomings of English learning in 'La Cena
delle Ceneri' (Ash Wednesday Conversation). But Bruno's roving
spirit, and perhaps also his heterodox tendencies, drove him at
last from England, and for the next five years he roamed about
Germany, leading the life of the wandering scholars of the time,
always involved in conflicts and controversies with the
authorities, always antagonistic to public opinion. Flying in the
face of the most cherished traditions, he underwent the common
experience of all prophets: the minds he was bent on awakening
refused to be aroused.</p>
<p>Finally he was invited by Zuone Mocenigo of Venice to teach him
the higher and secret learning. The Venetian supposed that Bruno,
with more than human erudition, possessed the art of conveying
knowledge into the heads of dullards. Disappointed in this
expectation, he quarreled with his teacher, and in a spirit of
revenge picked out of Bruno's writings a mass of testimony
sufficient to convict him of heresy. This he turned over to the
Inquisitor at Venice, Bruno was arrested, convicted, and sent to
the Inquisition in Rome. When called upon there to recant, he
replied, "I ought not to recant, and I will not recant." He was
accordingly confined in prison for seven years, then sentenced to
death. On hearing the warrant he said, "It may be that you fear
more to deliver this judgment than I to bear it." On February 17th,
1600, he was burned at the stake in the Campo de' Fiori at Rome. He
remained steadfast to the end, saying, "I die a martyr, and
willingly." His ashes were cast into the Tiber. Two hundred and
fifty-nine years afterwards, his statue was unveiled on the very
spot where he suffered; and the Italian government is bringing out
(1896) the first complete edition, the 'National Edition,' of his
works.</p>
<p>In their substance Bruno's writings belong to philosophy rather
than to literature, although they are still interesting both
historically and biographically as an index of the character of the
man and of the temper of the time. Many of the works have either
perished or are hidden away in inaccessible archives. For two
hundred years they were tabooed, and as late as 1836 forbidden to
be shown in the public library of Dresden. He published twenty-five
works in Latin and Italian, and left many others incomplete, for in
all his wanderings he was continually writing. The eccentric titles
show his desire to attract attention: as 'The Work of the Great
Key,' 'The Exploration of the Thirty Seals,' etc. The first extant
work is 'Il Candelajo' (The Taper), a comedy which in its license
of language and manner vividly reflects the time. In the dedication
he discloses his philosophy: 'Time takes away everything and gives
everything.' The 'Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante' (Expulsion of
the Triumphant Beast), the most celebrated of his works, is an
attack on the superstitions of the day, a curious medley of
learning, imagination, and buffoonery. 'Degl' Eroici Furori' (The
Heroic Enthusiasts) is the most interesting to modern readers, and
in its majestic exaltation and poetic imagery is a true product of
Italian culture.</p>
<p>Bruno was evidently a man of vast intellect and of immense
erudition. His philosophic speculations comprehended not only the
ancient thought, and that current at his time, but also reached out
toward the future and the results of modern science. He perceived
some of the facts which were later formulated in the theory of
evolution. "The mind of man differs from that of lower animals and
of plants not in quality but only in quantity.... Each individual
is the resultant of innumerable individuals. Each species is the
Starting point for the next.... No individual is the same to-day as
yesterday."</p>
<p>Not only in this divination of coming truths is he modern, but
also in his methods of investigation. Reason was to him the guide
to truth. In a study of him Lewes says:--"Bruno was a true
Neapolitan child--as ardent as its soil ... as capricious as its
varied climate. There was a restless energy which fitted him to
become the preacher of a new crusade--urging him to throw a haughty
defiance in the face of every authority in every country,--an
energy which closed his wild adventurous career at the stake." He
was distinguished also by a rich fancy, a varied humor, and a
chivalrous gallantry, which constantly remind us that the
intellectual athlete is an Italian, and an Italian of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<h3>A DISCOURSE OF POETS</h3>
<center>From 'The Heroic Enthusiasts'</center>
<br>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--Say, what do you mean by those who vaunt
themselves of myrtle and laurel?</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--Those may and do boast of the myrtle who sing
of love: if they bear themselves nobly, they may wear a crown of
that plant consecrated to Venus, of which they know the potency.
Those may boast of the laurel who sing worthily of things
pertaining to heroes, substituting heroic souls for speculative and
moral philosophy, praising them and setting them as mirrors and
exemplars for political and civil actions.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--There are then many species of poets and
crowns?</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--Not only as many as there are Muses, but a
great many more; for although genius is to be met with, yet certain
modes and species of human ingenuity cannot be thus classified.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--There are certain schoolmen who barely allow
Homer to be a poet, and set down Virgil, Ovid, Martial, Hesiod,
Lucretius, and many others as versifiers, judging them by the rules
of poetry of Aristotle.</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--Know for certain, my brother, that such as
these are beasts. They do not consider that those rules serve
principally as a frame for the Homeric poetry, and for other
similar to it; and they set up one as a great poet, high as Homer,
and disallow those of other vein and art and enthusiasm, who in
their various kinds are equal, similar, or greater.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--So that Homer was not a poet who depended upon
rules, but was the cause of the rules which serve for those who are
more apt at imitation than invention, and they have been used by
him who, being no poet, yet knew how to take the rules of Homeric
poetry into service, so as to become, not a poet or a Homer, but
one who apes the Muse of others?</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--Thou dost well conclude that poetry is not born
in rules, or only slightly and accidentally so: the rules are
derived, from the poetry, and there are as many kinds and sorts of
true rules as there are kinds and sorts of true poets.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--How then are the true poets to be known?</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--By the singing of their verses: in that singing
they give delight, or they edify, or they edify and delight
together.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--To whom then are the rules of Aristotle
useful?</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--To him who, unlike Homer, Hesiod, Orpheus, and
others, could not sing without the rules of Aristotle, and who,
having no Muse of his own, would coquette with that of Homer.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--Then they are wrong, those stupid pedants of our
days, who exclude from the number of poets those who do not use
words and metaphors conformable to, or whose principles are not in
union with, those of Homer and Virgil; or because they do not
observe the custom of invocation, or because they weave one history
or tale with another, or because they finish the song with an
epilogue on what has been said and a prelude on what is to be said,
and many other kinds of criticism and censure; from whence it seems
they would imply that they themselves, if the fancy took them,
could be the true poets: and yet in fact they are no other than
worms, that know not how to do anything well, but are born only to
gnaw and befoul the studies and labors of others; and not being
able to attain celebrity by their own virtue and ingenuity, seek to
put themselves in the front, by hook or by crook, through the
defects and errors of others.</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--There are as many sorts of poets as there are
sentiments and ideas; and to these it is possible to adapt
garlands, not only of every species of plant, but also of other
kinds of material. So the crowns of poets are made not only of
myrtle and of laurel, but of vine leaves for the white-wine verses,
and of ivy for the bacchanals; of olive for sacrifice and laws; of
poplar, of elm, and of corn for agriculture; of cypress for
funerals, and innumerable others for other occasions; and if it
please you, also of the material signified by a good fellow when he
exclaimed:</p>
<blockquote>"O Friar Leek! O Poetaster!<br>
That in Milan didst buckle on thy wreath<br>
Composed of salad, sausage, and the pepper-caster."</blockquote>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--Now surely he of divers moods, which he exhibits
in various ways, may cover himself with the branches of different
plants, and may hold discourse worthily with the Muses; for they
are his aura or comforter, his anchor or support, and his harbor,
to which he retires in times of labor, of agitation, and of storm.
Hence he cries:--"O Mountain of Parnassus, where I abide; Muses,
with whom I converse; Fountain of Helicon, where I am nourished;
Mountain, that affordest me a quiet dwelling-place; Muses, that
inspire me with profound doctrines; Fountain, that cleansest me;
Mountain, on whose ascent my heart uprises; Muses, that in
discourse revive my spirits; Fountain, whose arbors cool my
brows,--change my death into life, my cypress to laurels, and my
hells into heavens: that is, give me immortality, make me a poet,
render me illustrious!"</p>
<p><i>Tansillo</i>--Well; because to those whom Heaven favors, the
greatest evils turn to greatest good; for needs or necessities
bring forth labors and studies, and these most often bring the
glory of immortal splendor.</p>
<p><i>Cicada</i>--For to die in one age makes us live in all the
rest.</p>

<h2>WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT</h2>
<h3>(1794-1878)</h3>
<center>BY GEORGE PARSONS LATHROP</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-d.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>istinguished as he was by the lofty qualities of his verse,
William Cullen Bryant held a place almost unique in American
literature, by the union of his activity as a poet with his
eminence as a citizen and an influential journalist, throughout an
uncommonly long career. Two traits still further define the
peculiarity of his position--his precocious development, and the
evenness and sustained vigor of all his poetic work from the
beginning to the end. He began writing verse at the age of eight;
at ten he made contributions in this kind to the county gazette,
and produced a finished and effective rhymed address, read at his
school examination, which became popular for recitation; and in his
thirteenth year, during the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson, he
composed a political satire, 'The Embargo.' This, being published,
was at first supposed by many to be the work of a man, attracted
much attention and praise, and passed into a second edition with
other shorter pieces.</p>
<p>But these, while well wrought in the formal eighteenth-century
fashion, showed no special originality. It was with 'Thanatopsis,'
written in 1811, when he was only seventeen, that his career as a
poet of original and assured strength began. 'Thanatopsis' was an
inspiration of the primeval woods of America, of the scenes that
surrounded the writer in youth. At the same time it expressed with
striking independence and power a fresh conception of "the
universality of Death in the natural order." As has been well said,
"it takes the idea of death out of its theological aspects and
restores it to its proper place in the vast scheme of things. This
in itself was a mark of genius in a youth of his time and place."
Another American poet, Stoddard, calls it the greatest poem ever
written by so young a man. The author's son-in-law and biographer,
Parke Godwin, remarks upon it aptly, "For the first time on this
continent a poem was written destined to general admiration and
enduring fame;" and this indeed is a very significant point, that
it began the history of true poetry in the United States,--a fact
which further secured to Bryant his exceptional place. The poem
remains a classic of the English language, and the author himself
never surpassed the high mark attained in it; although the balanced
and lasting nature of his faculty is shown in a pendant to this
poem, which he created in his old age and entitled 'The Flood of
Years.' The last is equal to the first in dignity and finish, but
is less original, and has never gained a similar fame.</p>
<p>Another consideration regarding Bryant is, that representing a
modern development of poetry under American inspiration, he was
also a descendant of the early Massachusetts colonists, being
connected with the Pilgrim Fathers through three ancestral lines.
Born at Cummington, Massachusetts, November 3d, 1794, the son of a
stalwart but studious country physician of literary tastes, he
inherited the strong religious feeling of this ancestry, which was
united in him with a deep and sensitive love of nature. This led
him to reflect in his poems the strength and beauty of American
landscape, vividly as it had never before been mirrored; and the
blending of serious thought and innate piety with the sentiment for
nature so reflected gave a new and impressive result.</p>
<p>Like many other long-lived men, Bryant suffered from delicate
health in the earlier third of his life: there was a tendency to
consumption in his otherwise vigorous family stock. He read much,
and was much interested in Greek literature and somewhat influenced
by it. But he also lived a great deal in the open air, rejoiced in
the boisterous games and excursions in the woods with his brothers
and sisters, and took long rambles alone among the hills and wild
groves; being then, as always afterwards, an untiring walker. After
a stay of only seven months at Williams College, he studied law,
which he practiced for some eight years in Plainfield and Great
Barrington. In the last-named village he was elected a tithingman,
charged with the duty of keeping order in the churches and
enforcing the observance of Sunday. Chosen town clerk soon
afterwards, at a salary of five dollars a year, he kept the records
of the town with his own hand for five years, and also served as
justice of the peace with power to hear cases in a lower court.
These biographical items are of value, as showing his close
relation to the self-government of the people in its simpler forms,
and his early practical familiarity with the duties of a trusted
citizen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, he kept on writing at intervals, and in 1821
read before the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Harvard a long poem, 'The
Ages,' a kind of composition more in favor at that period than in
later days, being a general review of the progress of man in
knowledge and virtue. With the passage of time it has not held its
own as against some of his other poems, although it long enjoyed a
high reputation; but its success on its original hearing was the
cause of his bringing together his first volume of poems, hardly
more than a pamphlet, in the same year. It made him famous with the
reading public of the United States, and won some recognition in
England. In this little book were contained, besides 'The Ages' and
'Thanatopsis,' several pieces which have kept their hold upon
popular taste; such as the well-known lines 'To a Waterfowl' and
the 'Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood.'</p>
<br>

<p class="ctr"><a href="images/bryant.jpg"><img src=
"images/bryant.jpg" width="45%" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The year of its publication also brought into the world Cooper's
'The Spy,' Irving's 'Sketch Book' and 'Bracebridge Hall,' with
various other significant volumes, including Channing's early
essays and Daniel Webster's great Plymouth Oration. It was evident
that a native literature was dawning brightly; and as Bryant's
productions now came into demand, and he had never liked the
profession of law, he quitted it and went to New York in 1825,
there to seek a living by his pen as "a literary adventurer." The
adventure led to ultimate triumph, but not until after a long term
of dark prospects and hard struggles.</p>
<p>Even in his latest years Bryant used to declare that his
favorite among his poems--although it is one of the least
known--was 'Green River'; perhaps because it recalled the scenes of
young manhood, when he was about entering the law, and contrasted
the peacefulness of that stream with the life in which he would
be</p>
<blockquote>"Forced to drudge for the dregs of men,<br>
And scrawl strange words with the barbarous pen,<br>
And mingle among the jostling crowd,<br>
Where the sons of strife are subtle and loud."</blockquote>
<p>This might be applied to much of his experience in New York,
where he edited the New York Review and became one of the editors,
then a proprietor, and finally chief editor of the Evening Post. A
great part of his energies now for many years was given to his
journalistic function, and to the active outspoken discussion of
important political questions; often in trying crises and at the
cost of harsh unpopularity. Success, financial as well as moral,
came to him within the next quarter-century, during which laborious
interval he had likewise maintained his interest and work in pure
literature and produced new poems from time to time in various
editions.</p>
<p>From this point on until his death, June 12th, 1878, in his
eighty-fourth year, he was the central and commanding figure in the
enlarging literary world of New York. His newspaper had gained a
potent reputation, and it brought to bear upon public affairs a
strong influence of the highest sort. Its editorial course and
tone, as well as the earnest and patriotic part taken by Bryant in
popular questions and national affairs, without political ambition
or office-holding, had established him as one of the most
distinguished citizens of the metropolis, no less than its most
renowned poet. His presence and co-operation were indispensable in
all great public functions or humanitarian and intellectual
movements. In 1864 his seventieth birthday was celebrated at the
Century Club with extraordinary honors. In 1875, again, the two
houses of the State Legislature at Albany paid him the compliment,
unprecedented in the annals of American authorship, of inviting him
to a reception given to him in their official capacity. Another
mark of the abounding esteem in which he was held among his
fellow-citizens was the presentation to him in 1876 of a rich
silver vase, commemorative of his life and works. He was now a
wealthy man; yet his habits of life remained essentially unchanged.
His tastes were simple, his love of nature was still ardent; his
literary and editorial industry unflagging.</p>
<p>Besides his poems, Bryant wrote two short stories for 'Tales of
the Glauber Spa'; and published 'Letters of a Traveler' in 1850, as
a result of three journeys to Europe and the Orient, together with
various public addresses. His style as a writer of prose is clear,
calm, dignified, and denotes exact observation and a wide range of
interests. So too his editorial articles in the Evening Post, some
of which have been preserved in his collected writings, are couched
in serene and forcible English, with nothing of the sensational or
the colloquial about them. They were a fitting medium of expression
for his firm conscientiousness and integrity as a journalist.</p>
<p>But it is as a poet, and especially by a few distinctive
compositions, that Bryant will be most widely and deeply held in
remembrance. In the midst of the exacting business of his career as
an editor, and many public or social demands upon his time, he
found opportunity to familiarize himself with portions of German
and Spanish poetry, which he translated, and to maintain in the
quietude of his country home in Roslyn, Long Island, his old
acquaintance with the Greek and Latin classics. From this continued
study there resulted naturally in 1870 his elaborate translation of
Homer's Iliad, which was followed by that of the Odyssey in 1871.
These scholarly works, cast in strong and polished blank verse, won
high praise from American critics, and even achieved a popular
success, although they were not warmly acclaimed, in England. Among
literarians they are still regarded as in a manner standards of
their kind. Bryant, in his long march of over sixty-five years
across the literary field, was witness to many new developments in
poetic writing, in both his own and other countries. But while he
perceived the splendor and color and rich novelty of these, he held
in his own work to the plain theory and practice which had guided
him from the start. "The best poetry," he still believed--"that
which takes the strongest hold of the general mind, not in one age
only but in all ages--is that which is always simple and always
luminous." He did not embody in impassioned forms the sufferings,
emotions, or problems of the human kind, but was disposed to
generalize them, as in 'The Journey of Life,' the 'Hymn of the
City,' and 'The Song of the Sower,' it is characteristic that two
of the longer poems, 'Sella' and 'The Little People of the Snow,'
which are narratives, deal with legends of an individual human life
merging itself with the inner life of nature, under the form of
imaginary beings who dwell in the snow or in water. On the other
hand, one of his eulogists observes that although some of his
contemporaries went much beyond him in fullness of insight and
nearness to the great conflicts of the age, "he has certainly not
been surpassed, perhaps not been approached, by any writer since
Wordsworth, in that majestic repose and that self-reliant
simplicity which characterized the morning stars of song." In 'Our
Country's Call,' however, one hears the ring of true martial
enthusiasm; and there is a deep patriotic fervor in 'O Mother of a
Mighty Race.' The noble and sympathetic homage paid to the typical
womanhood of a genuine woman of every day, in 'The Conqueror's
Grave,' reveals also great underlying warmth and sensitiveness of
feeling. 'Robert of Lincoln,' and 'The Planting of the Apple-Tree'
are both touched with a lighter mood of joy in nature, which
supplies a contrast to his usual pensiveness.</p>
<p>Bryant's venerable aspect in old age--with erect form, white
hair, and flowing snowy beard--gave him a resemblance to Homer; and
there was something Homeric about his influence upon the literature
of his country, in the dignity with which he invested the poetic
art and the poet's relation to the people.</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To him who in the love of Nature
holds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communion with her visible forms, she
speaks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A various language; for his gayer
hours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has a voice of gladness, and a
smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eloquence of beauty, and she
glides<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his darker musings, with a

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And healing sympathy, that steals
away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sharpness ere he is aware. When
thoughts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the last bitter hour come like a
blight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over thy spirit, and sad images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the stern agony, and shroud, and
pall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathless darkness, and the

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The all-beholding sun shall see no
more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his course; nor yet in the
cold ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thy pale form was laid, with
many tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall
exist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy image. Earth, that nourished
thee, shall claim<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy growth, to be resolved to earth
again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lost each human trace,
surrendering up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine individual being, shalt thou
go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mix for ever with the
elements,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a brother to the insensible
rock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the sluggish clod, which the
rude swain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns with his share, and treads
upon. The oak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall send his roots abroad, and
pierce thy mold.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not to thine eternal
resting-place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst
thou wish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt
lie down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With patriarchs of the infant
world--with kings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powerful of the earth--the wise,
the good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages
past,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in one mighty sepulchre. The
hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock-ribbed and ancient as the
sun,--the vales<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretching in pensive quietness
between;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The venerable woods--rivers that
move<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In majesty, and the complaining
brooks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That make the meadows green; and,
poured round all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Ocean's gray and melancholy
waste,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are but the solemn decorations
all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the great tomb of man. The golden
sun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The planets, all the infinite host of
heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are shining on the sad abodes of
death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the still lapse of ages. All
that tread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The globe are but a handful to the
tribes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That slumber in its bosom.--Take the
wings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of morning, pierce the Barcan
wilderness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lose thyself in the continuous
woods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no
sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save his own dashings--yet the dead
are there;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And millions in those solitudes,
since first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight of years began, have laid
them down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their last sleep--the dead reign
there alone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So shalt thou rest; and what if thou
withdraw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In silence from the living, and no
friend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take note of thy departure? All that
breathe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will share thy destiny. The gay will
laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou art gone, the solemn brood
of care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plod on, and each one as before will
chase<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His favorite phantom; yet all these
shall leave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their mirth and their employments,
and shall come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make their bed with thee. As the
long train<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ages glides away, the sons of
men,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth in life's fresh spring and
he who goes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the full strength of years, matron
and maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speechless babe and the
gray-headed man--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall one by one be gathered to thy
side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By those who in their turn shall
follow them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So live, that when thy
summons comes to join<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innumerable caravan which
moves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that mysterious realm where each
shall take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chamber in the silent halls of
death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at
night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scourged to his dungeon; but,
sustained and soothed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By an unfaltering trust, approach thy
grave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one who wraps the drapery of his
couch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About him, and lies down to pleasant
dreams.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>THE DEATH OF THE
FLOWERS</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The melancholy days are come, the
saddest of the year,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wailing winds, and naked woods,
and meadows brown and sere.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaped in the hollows of the grove,
the autumn leaves lie dead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rustle to the eddying gust, and
to the rabbit's tread.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robin and the wren are flown, and
from the shrubs the jay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the wood-top calls the crow
through all the gloomy day.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where are the flowers, the fair young
flowers, that lately sprang and stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brighter light and softer airs, a
beauteous sisterhood?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! they all are in their graves;
the gentle race of flowers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are lying in their lowly beds, with
the fair and good of ours.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rain is falling where they lie,
but the cold November rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calls not from out the gloomy earth
the lovely ones again.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind-flower and the violet, they
perished long ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brier-rose and the orchis
died amid the summer glow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But on the hills the golden-rod, and
the aster in the wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the yellow sunflower by the
brook, in autumn beauty stood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till fell the frost from the clear
cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brightness of their smile was
gone from upland, glade, and glen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, when comes the calm mild
day, as still such days will come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To call the squirrel and the bee from
out their winter home;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the sound of dropping nuts is
heard, though all the trees are still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twinkle in the smoky light the
waters of the rill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south-wind searches for the
flowers whose fragrance late he bore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sighs to find them in the wood
and by the stream no more.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I think of one who in her
youthful beauty died,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fair meek blossom that grew up
and faded by my side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cold moist earth we laid her,
when the forests cast the leaf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we wept that one so lovely should
have a life so brief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not unmeet it was that one like
that young friend of ours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So gentle and so beautiful, should
perish with the flowers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>THE CONQUEROR'S
GRAVE</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this lowly grave a Conqueror
lies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet the monument
proclaims it not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor round the sleeper's
name hath chisel wrought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emblems of a fame that never
dies,--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivy and amaranth, in a graceful
sheaf,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twined with the laurel's fair,
imperial leaf.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple name
alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the great
world unknown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is graven here, and wild-flowers
rising round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meek meadow-sweet and violets of the
ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lean lovingly against the
humble stone.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, in the quiet earth, they laid
apart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man of iron mold and
bloody hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who sought to wreak upon
the cowering lands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The passions that consumed his
restless heart:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of tender spirit and delicate
frame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gentlest, in
mien and mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of gentle
womankind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timidly shrinking from the breath of
blame;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One in whose eyes the smile of
kindness made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its haunts, like flowers
by sunny brooks in May,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, at the thought of others' pain,
a shade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sweeter sadness chased
the smile away.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor deem that when the hand that
molders here<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was raised in menace, realms were
chilled with fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And armies mustered at
the sign, as when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clouds rise on clouds before the
rainy East--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray captains leading
bands of veteran men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fiery youths to be the vulture's
feast.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not thus were waged the mighty wars
that gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victory to her who fills this
grave:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone her
task was wrought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone the
battle fought;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through that long strife her constant
hope was staid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On God alone, nor looked for other
aid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met the hosts of Sorrow with a
look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That altered not beneath
the frown they wore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon the lowering brood were
tamed, and took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly her gentle rule,
and frowned no more.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her soft hand put aside the assaults
of wrath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
calmly broke in twain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
fiery shafts of pain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rent the nets of passion from her
path.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that victorious hand
despair was slain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With love she vanquished hate and
overcame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evil with good, in her Great Master's
name.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her glory is not of this shadowy
state,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glory that with the
fleeting season dies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when she entered at the sapphire
gate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What joy was radiant in
celestial eyes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How heaven's bright depths with
sounding welcomes rung,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers of heaven by shining
hands were flung!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
He who long before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain,
scorn, and sorrow bore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mighty Sufferer, with aspect
sweet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiled on the timid stranger from his
seat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who returning,
glorious, from the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dragged Death disarmed,
in chains, a crouching slave.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, as I linger here, the sun grows
low;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool airs are murmuring
that the night is near.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O gentle sleeper, from the grave I
go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consoled though sad, in
hope and yet in fear.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Brief is the time, I know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The warfare scarce begun;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet all may win the triumphs thou
hast won.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still flows the fount whose waters
strengthened thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victors' names are
yet too few to fill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven's mighty roll; the glorious
armory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ministered to thee,
is open still.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>JUNE</b><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I gazed upon the glorious sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the green mountains
round;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought that when I came to
lie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At rest within the
ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twere pleasant that in flowery
June,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When brooks send up a cheerful
tune<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And groves a joyous
sound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sexton's hand, my grave to
make,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rich green mountain turf should
break.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cell within the frozen mold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coffin borne through
sleet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And icy clods above it rolled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While fierce the tempests
beat--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away! I will not think of these:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue be the sky and soft the
breeze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth green beneath the
feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And be the damp mold gently
pressed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into my narrow place of rest.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There through the long, long summer
hours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden light should
lie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thick young herbs and groups of
flowers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand in their beauty
by;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oriole should build and tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His love-tale close beside my
cell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idle butterfly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should rest him there, and there be
heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The housewife bee and
humming-bird.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what if cheerful shouts at
noon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, from the village
sent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or songs of maids beneath the
moon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fairy laughter
blent?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what if, in the evening
light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Betrothed lovers walk in sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my low monument?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would the lovely scene around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might know no sadder sight nor
sound.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I no more should see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The season's glorious
show,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor would its brightness shine for
me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor its wild music
flow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if, around my place of sleep.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The friends I love should come to
weep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might not haste to
go.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft airs, and song, and light, and
bloom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should keep them lingering by my
tomb.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These to their softened hearts should
bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thought of what has
been,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And speak of one who cannot share<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gladness of the
scene;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose part in all the pomp that
fills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circuit of the summer hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is--that his grave is
green;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deeply would their hearts
rejoice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear again his living
voice.</blockquote>

<h2>JAMES BRYCE</h2>
<h3>(1838-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ames Bryce was born at Belfast, Ireland, of Scotch and Irish
parents. He studied at the University of Glasgow and later at
Oxford, where he graduated with high honors in 1862, and where
after some years of legal practice he was appointed Regius
Professor of Civil Law in 1870. He had already established a high
reputation as an original and accurate historical scholar by his
prize essay on the 'Holy Roman Empire' (1864), which passed through
many editions, was translated into German, French, and Italian, and
remains to-day a standard work and the best known work on the
subject, Edward A. Freeman said on the appearance of the work that
it had raised the author at once to the rank of a great historian.
It has done more than any other treatise to clarify the vague
notions of historians as to the significance of the imperial idea
in the Middle Ages, and its importance as a factor in German and
Italian politics; and it is safe to say that there is scarcely a
recent history of the period that does not show traces of its
influence. The scope of this work being juristic and philosophical,
it does not admit of much historical narrative, and the style is
lucid but not brilliant. It is not in fact as a historian that Mr.
Bryce is best known, but rather as a jurist, a politician, and a
student of institutions.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/bryce.jpg" width="45%" alt=""><br>
<b>James Bryce</b></p>
<p>The most striking characteristic of the man is his versatility;
a quality which in his case has not been accompanied by its usual
defects, for his achievements in one field seem to have made him no
less conscientious in others, while they have given him that
breadth of view which is more essential than any special training
to the critic of men and affairs. For the ten years that followed
his Oxford appointment he contributed frequently to the magazines
on geographical, social, and political topics. His vacations he
spent in travel and in mountain climbing, of which he gave an
interesting narrative in 'Transcaucasia and Ararat' (1877). In 1880
he entered active politics, and was elected to Parliament in the
Liberal interest. He has continued steadfast in his support of the
Liberal party and of Mr. Gladstone, whose Home Rule policy he has
heartily seconded. In 1886 he became Gladstone's Under-Secretary of
Foreign Affairs, and in 1894 was appointed President of the Board
of Trade.</p>
<p>The work by which he is best known in this country, the
'American Commonwealth' (1888), is the fruit of his observations
during three visits to the United States, and of many years of
study. It is generally conceded to be the best critical analysis of
American institutions ever made by a foreign author. Inferior in
point of style to De Tocqueville's 'Democracy in America,' it far
surpasses that book in amplitude, breadth of view, acuteness of
observation, and minuteness of information; besides being half a
century later in date, and therefore able to set down accomplished
facts where the earlier observer could only make forecasts. His
extensive knowledge of foreign countries, by divesting him of
insular prejudice, fitted him to handle his theme with
impartiality, and his experience in the practical workings of
British institutions gave him an insight into the practical defects
and benefits of ours. That he has a keen eye for defects is
obvious, but his tone is invariably sympathetic; so much so, in
fact, that Goldwin Smith has accused him of being somewhat "hard on
England" in some of his comparisons. The faults of the book pertain
rather to the manner than to the matter. He does not mislead, but
sometimes wearies, and in some portions of the work the frequent
repetitions, the massing of details, and the absence of compact
statement tend to obscure the general drift of his argument and to
add unduly to the bulkiness of his volumes.</p>

<h3>THE POSITION OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES</h3>
<center>From 'The American Commonwealth'</center>
<br>
<p>Social intercourse between youths and maidens is everywhere more
easy and unrestrained than in England or Germany, not to speak of
France. Yet there are considerable differences between the Eastern
cities, whose usages have begun to approximate to those of Europe,
and other parts of the country. In the rural districts, and
generally all over the West, young men and girls are permitted to
walk together, drive together, go out to parties and even to public
entertainments together, without the presence of any third person
who can be supposed to be looking after or taking charge of the
girl. So a girl may, if she pleases, keep up a correspondence with
a young man, nor will her parents think of interfering. She will
have her own friends, who when they call at her house ask for her,
and are received by her, it may be alone; because they are not
deemed to be necessarily the friends of her parents also, nor even
of her sisters.</p>
<p>In the cities of the Atlantic States it is now thought scarcely
correct for a young man to take a young lady out for a solitary
drive; and in few sets would he be permitted to escort her alone to
the theatre. But girls still go without chaperons to dances, the
hostess being deemed to act as chaperon for all her guests; and as
regards both correspondence and the right to have one's own circle
of acquaintances, the usage even of New York or Boston allows more
liberty than does that of London or Edinburgh. It was at one time,
and it may possibly still be, not uncommon for a group of young
people who know one another well to make up an autumn "party in the
woods." They choose some mountain and forest region, such as the
Adirondack Wilderness west of Lake Champlain, engage three or four
guides, embark with guns and fishing-rods, tents, blankets, and a
stock of groceries, and pass in boats up the rivers and across the
lakes of this wild country through sixty or seventy miles of
trackless forest, to their chosen camping-ground at the foot of
some tall rock that rises from the still crystal of the lake. Here
they build their bark hut, and spread their beds of the elastic and
fragrant hemlock boughs; the youths roam about during the day,
tracking the deer, the girls read and work and bake the corn-cakes;
at night there is a merry gathering round the fire, or a row in the
soft moonlight. On these expeditions brothers will take their
sisters and cousins, who bring perhaps some lady friends with them;
the brothers' friends will come too; and all will live together in
a fraternal way for weeks or months, though no elderly relative or
married lady be of the party.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the pleasure of life is sensibly
increased by the greater freedom which transatlantic custom
permits; and as the Americans insist that no bad results have
followed, one notes with regret that freedom declines in the places
which deem themselves most civilized. American girls have been, so
far as a stranger can ascertain, less disposed to what are called
"fast ways" than girls of the corresponding classes in England, and
exercise in this respect a pretty rigorous censorship over one
another. But when two young people find pleasure in one another's
company, they can see as much of each other as they please, can
talk and walk together frequently, can show that they are mutually
interested, and yet need have little fear of being misunderstood
either by one another or by the rest of the world. It is all a
matter of custom. In the West, custom sanctions this easy
friendship; in the Atlantic cities, so soon as people have come to
find something exceptional in it, constraint is felt, and a
conventional etiquette like that of the Old World begins to replace
the innocent simplicity of the older time, the test of whose merit
may be gathered from the universal persuasion in America that happy
marriages are in the middle and upper ranks more common than in
Europe, and that this is due to the ampler opportunities which
young men and women have of learning one another's characters and
habits before becoming betrothed. Most girls have a larger range of
intimate acquaintances than girls have in Europe, intercourse is
franker, there is less difference between the manners of home and
the manners of general society. The conclusions of a stranger are
in such matters of no value; so I can only repeat that I have never
met any judicious American lady who, however well she knew the Old
World, did not think that the New World customs conduced more both
to the pleasantness of life before marriage, and to constancy and
concord after it.</p>
<p>In no country are women, and especially young women, so much
made of. The world is at their feet. Society seems organized for
the purpose of providing enjoyment for them. Parents, uncles,
aunts, elderly friends, even brothers, are ready to make their
comfort and convenience bend to the girls' wishes. The wife has
fewer opportunities for reigning over the world of amusements,
because except among the richest people she has more to do in
household management than in England, owing to the scarcity of
servants; but she holds in her own house a more prominent if not a
more substantially powerful position than in England or even in
France. With the German <i>haus-frau</i>, who is too often content
to be a mere housewife, there is of course no comparison. The best
proof of the superior place American ladies occupy is to be found
in the notions they profess to entertain of the relations of an
English married pair. They talk of the English wife as little
better than a slave; declaring that when they stay with English
friends, or receive an English couple in America, they see the wife
always deferring to the husband and the husband always assuming
that his pleasure and convenience are to prevail. The European
wife, they admit, often gets her own way, but she gets it by
tactful arts, by flattery or wheedling or playing on the man's
weaknesses; whereas in America the husband's duty and desire is to
gratify the wife, and render to her those services which the
English tyrant exacts from his consort. One may often hear an
American matron commiserate a friend who has married in Europe,
while the daughters declare in chorus that they will never follow
the example. Laughable as all this may seem to English women, it is
perfectly true that the theory as well as the practice of conjugal
life is not the same in America as in England. There are
overbearing husbands in America, but they are more condemned by the
opinion of the neighborhood than in England. There are exacting
wives in England, but their husbands are more pitied than would be
the case in America. In neither country can one say that the
principle of perfect equality reigns; for in America the balance
inclines nearly, though not quite, as much in favor of the wife as
it does in England in favor of the husband. No one man can have a
sufficiently large acquaintance in both countries to entitle his
individual opinion on the results to much weight. So far as I have
been able to collect views from those observers who have lived in
both countries, they are in favor of the American practice, perhaps
because the theory it is based on departs less from pure equality
than does that of England. These observers do not mean that the
recognition of women as equals or superiors makes them any better
or sweeter or wiser than Englishwomen; but rather that the
principle of equality, by correcting the characteristic faults of
men, and especially their selfishness and vanity, is more conducive
to the concord and happiness of a home. They conceive that to make
the wife feel her independence and responsibility more strongly
than she does in Europe tends to brace and expand her character;
while conjugal affection, usually stronger in her than in the
husband, inasmuch as there are fewer competing interests, saves her
from abusing the precedence yielded to her. This seems to be true;
but I have heard others maintain that the American system, since it
does not require the wife habitually to forego her own wishes,
tends, if not to make her self-indulgent and capricious, yet
slightly to impair the more delicate charms of character; as it is
written, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."</p>
<p>A European cannot spend an evening in an American drawing-room
without perceiving that the attitude of men to women is not that
with which he is familiar at home. The average European man has
usually a slight sense of condescension when he talks to a woman on
serious subjects. Even if she is his superior in intellect, in
character, in social rank, he thinks that as a man he is her
superior, and consciously or unconsciously talks down to her. She
is too much accustomed to this to resent it, unless it becomes
tastelessly palpable. Such a notion does not cross an American's
mind. He talks to a woman just as he would to a man; of course with
more deference of manner, and with a proper regard to the topics
likely to interest her, but giving her his intellectual best,
addressing her as a person whose opinion is understood by both to
be worth as much as his own. Similarly an American lady does not
expect to have conversation made to her: it is just as much her
duty or pleasure to lead it as the man's is; and more often than
not she takes the burden from him, darting along with a gay
vivacity which puts to shame his slower wits.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that in all cases where the two sexes
come into competition for comfort, the provision is made first for
women. In railroads the end car of the train, being that farthest
removed from the smoke of the locomotive, is often reserved for
them (though men accompanying a lady are allowed to enter it); and
at hotels their sitting-room is the best and sometimes the only
available public room, ladyless guests being driven to the bar or
the hall. In omnibuses and horse-cars (tram-cars), it was formerly
the custom for a gentleman to rise and offer his seat to a lady if
there were no vacant place. This is now less universally done. In
New York and Boston (and I think also in San Francisco), I have
seen the men keep their seats when ladies entered; and I recollect
one occasion when the offer of a seat to a lady was declined by
her, on the ground that as she had chosen to enter a full car she
ought to take the consequences. It was (I was told in Boston) a
feeling of this kind that had led to the discontinuance of the old
courtesy: when ladies constantly pressed into the already crowded
vehicles, the men, who could not secure the enforcement of the
regulations against over-crowding, tried to protect themselves by
refusing to rise. It is sometimes said that the privileges yielded
to American women have disposed them to claim as a right what was
only a courtesy, and have told unfavorably upon their manners. I
know of several instances, besides this one of the horse-cars,
which might seem to support the criticism, but cannot on the whole
think it well founded. The better-bred women do not presume on
their sex, and the area of good breeding is always widening. It
need hardly be said that the community at large gains by the
softening and restraining influence which the reverence for
womanhood diffuses. Nothing so quickly incenses the people as any
insult offered to a woman. Wife-beating, and indeed any kind of
rough violence offered to women, is far less common among the
rudest class than it is in England. Field work or work at the
pit-mouth of mines is seldom or never done by women in America; and
the American traveler who in some parts of Europe finds women
performing severe manual labor, is revolted by the sight in a way
which Europeans find surprising.</p>
<p>In the farther West, that is to say, beyond the Mississippi, in
the Rocky Mountain and Pacific States, one is much struck by what
seems the absence of the humblest class of women. The trains are
full of poorly dressed and sometimes (though less frequently)
rough-mannered men. One discovers no women whose dress or air marks
them out as the wives, daughters, or sisters of these men, and
wonders whether the male population is celibate, and if so, why
there are so many women. Closer observation shows that the wives,
daughters, and sisters are there, only their attire and manner are
those of what Europeans would call middle-class and not
working-class people. This is partly due to the fact that Western
men affect a rough dress. Still one may say that the remark so
often made, that the masses of the American people correspond to
the middle class of Europe, is more true of the women than of the
men; and is more true of them, in the rural districts and in the
West than it is of the inhabitants of Atlantic cities. I remember
to have been dawdling in a book-store in a small town in Oregon
when a lady entered to inquire if a monthly magazine, whose name
was unknown to me, had yet arrived. When she was gone I asked the
salesman who she was, and what was the periodical she wanted. He
answered that she was the wife of a railway workman, that the
magazine was a journal of fashions, and that the demand for such
journals was large and constant among women of the wage-earning
class in the town. This set me to observing female dress more
closely; and it turned out to be perfectly true that the women in
these little towns were following the Parisian fashions very
closely, and were in fact ahead of the majority of English ladies
belonging to the professional and mercantile classes. Of course in
such a town as I refer to, there are no domestic servants except in
the hotels (indeed, almost the only domestic service to be had in
the Pacific States was till very recently that of Chinese), so
these votaries of fashion did all their own housework and looked
after their own babies.</p>
<p>Three causes combine to create among American women an average
of literary taste and influence higher than that of women in any
European country. These are the educational facilities they enjoy,
the recognition of the equality of the sexes in the whole social
and intellectual sphere, and the leisure which they possess as
compared with men. In a country where men are incessantly occupied
at their business or profession, the function of keeping up the
level of culture devolves upon women. It is safe in their hands.
They are quick and keen-witted, less fond of open-air life and
physical exertion than English women are, and obliged by the
climate to pass a greater part of their time under shelter from the
cold of winter and the sun of summer. For music and for the
pictorial arts they do not yet seem to have formed so strong a
taste as for literature; partly perhaps owing to the fact that in
America the opportunities of seeing and hearing masterpieces,
except indeed operas, are rarer than in Europe. But they are eager
and assiduous readers of all such books and periodicals as do not
presuppose special knowledge in some branch of science or learning,
while the number who have devoted themselves to some special study
and attained proficiency in it is large. The fondness for
sentiment, especially moral and domestic sentiment, which is often
observed as characterizing American taste in literature, seems to
be mainly due to the influence of women, for they form not only the
larger part of the reading public, but an independent-minded part,
not disposed to adopt the canons laid down by men, and their
preferences count for more in the opinions and predilections of the
whole nation than is the case in England. Similarly the number of
women who write is infinitely larger in America than in Europe.
Fiction, essays, and poetry are naturally their favorite provinces.
In poetry more particularly, many whose names are quite unknown in
Europe have attained wide-spread fame.</p>
<p>Some one may ask how far the differences between the position of
women in America and their position in Europe are due to democracy?
or if not to this, then to what other cause?</p>
<p>They are due to democratic feeling, in so far as they spring
from the notion that all men are free and equal, possessed of
certain inalienable rights and owing certain corresponding duties.
This root idea of democracy cannot stop at defining men as male
human beings, any more than it could ultimately stop at defining
them as white human beings. For many years the Americans believed
in equality with the pride of discoverers as well as with the
fervor of apostles. Accustomed to apply it to all sorts and
conditions of men, they were naturally the first to apply it to
women also; not indeed as respects politics, but in all the social
as well as legal relations of life. Democracy is in America more
respectful of the individual, less disposed to infringe his freedom
or subject him to any sort of legal or family control, than it has
shown itself in Continental Europe; and this regard for the
individual inured to the benefit of women. Of the other causes that
have worked in the same direction, two may be mentioned. One is the
usage of the Congregationalist, Presbyterian, and Baptist churches,
under which a woman who is a member of the congregation has the
same rights in choosing a deacon, elder, or pastor, as a man has.
Another is the fact that among the westward-moving settlers women
were at first few in number, and were therefore treated with
special respect. The habit then formed was retained as the
communities grew, and propagated itself all over the country.</p>
<p>What have been the results on the character and usefulness of
women themselves?</p>
<p>Favorable. They have opened to them a wider life and more
variety of career. While the special graces of the feminine
character do not appear to have suffered, there has been produced a
sort of independence and a capacity for self-help which are
increasingly valuable as the number of unmarried women increases.
More resources are open to an American woman who has to lead a
solitary life, not merely in the way of employment, but for the
occupation of her mind and tastes, than to a European spinster or
widow; while her education has not rendered the American wife less
competent for the discharge of household duties.</p>
<p>How has the nation at large been affected by the development of
this new type of womanhood, or rather perhaps of this variation on
the English type?</p>
<p>If women have on the whole gained, it is clear that the nation
gains through them. As mothers they mold the character of their
children; while the function of forming the habits of society and
determining its moral tone rests greatly in their hands. But there
is reason to think that the influence of the American system tells
directly for good upon men as well as upon the whole community. Men
gain in being brought to treat women as equals, rather than as
graceful playthings or useful drudges. The respect for women which
every American man either feels, or is obliged by public sentiment
to profess, has a wholesome effect on his conduct and character,
and serves to check the cynicism which some other peculiarities of
the country foster. The nation as a whole owes to the active
benevolence of its women, and their zeal in promoting social
reforms, benefits which the customs of Continental Europe would
scarcely have permitted women to confer. Europeans have of late
years begun to render a well-deserved admiration to the brightness
and vivacity of American ladies. Those who know the work they have
done and are doing in many a noble cause will admire still more
their energy, their courage, their self-devotion. No country seems
to owe more to its women than America does, nor to owe to them so
much of what is best in social institutions and in the beliefs that
govern conduct.</p>

<h3>THE ASCENT OF ARARAT</h3>
<center>From 'Trans-Caucasia and Ararat'</center>
<br>
<p>About 1 A.M. we got off, thirteen in all, and made straight
across the grassy hollows for the ridges which trend up towards the
great cone, running parallel in a west-north-westerly direction,
and inclosing between them several long narrow depressions, hardly
deep enough to be called valleys. The Kurds led the way, and at
first we made pretty good progress. The Cossacks seemed fair
walkers, though less stalwart than the Kurds; the pace generally
was better than that with which Swiss guides start. However, we
were soon cruelly undeceived. In twenty-five minutes there came a
steep bit, and at the top of it they flung themselves down on the
grass to rest. So did we all. Less than half a mile farther, down
they dropped again, and this time we were obliged to give the
signal for resuming the march. In another quarter of an hour they
were down once more, and so it continued for the rest of the way.
Every ten minutes' walking--it was seldom steep enough to be called
actual climbing--was followed by seven or eight minutes of sitting
still, smoking and chattering. How they did chatter! It was to no
purpose that we continued to move on when they sat down, or that we
rose to go before they had sufficiently rested. They looked at one
another, so far as I could make out by the faint light, and
occasionally they laughed; but they would not and did not stir till
such time as pleased themselves. We were helpless. Impossible to go
on alone; impossible also to explain to them why every moment was
precious, for the acquaintance who had acted as interpreter had
been obliged to stay behind at Sardarbulakh, and we were absolutely
without means of communication with our companions. One could not
even be angry, had there been any use in that, for they were
perfectly good-humored. It was all very well to beckon them, or
pull them by the elbow, or clap them on the back; they thought this
was only our fun, and sat still and chattered all the same. When it
grew light enough to see the hands of a watch, and mark how the
hours advanced while the party did not, we began for a second time
to despair of success.</p>
<p>About 3 A.M. there suddenly sprang up from behind the Median
mountains the morning star, shedding a light such as no star ever
gave in these northern climes of ours,--a light that almost
outshone the moon. An hour later it began to pale in the first
faint flush of yellowish light that spread over the eastern heaven;
and first the rocky masses above us, then Little Ararat, throwing
behind him a gigantic shadow, then the long lines of mountains
beyond the Araxes, became revealed, while the wide Araxes plain
still lay dim and shadowy below. One by one the stars died out as
the yellow turned to a deeper glow that shot forth in long
streamers, the rosy fingers of the dawn, from the horizon to the
zenith. Cold and ghostly lay the snows on the mighty cone; till at
last there came upon their topmost slope, six thousand feet above
us, a sudden blush of pink. Swiftly it floated down the eastern
face, and touched and kindled the rocks just above us. Then the sun
flamed out, and in a moment the Araxes valley and all the hollows
of the savage ridges we were crossing were flooded with
overpowering light.</p>
<p>It was nearly six o'clock, and progress became easier now that
we could see our way distinctly. The Cossacks seemed to grow
lazier, halting as often as before and walking less briskly; in
fact, they did not relish the exceeding roughness of the jagged
lava ridges along whose tops or sides we toiled. I could willingly
have lingered here myself; for in the hollows, wherever a little
soil appeared, some interesting plants were growing, whose
similarity to and difference from the Alpine species of Western
Europe alike excited one's curiosity. Time allowed me to secure
only a few; I trusted to get more on the way back, but this turned
out to be impossible. As we scrambled along a ridge above a long
narrow winding glen filled with loose blocks, one of the Kurds
suddenly swooped down like a vulture from the height on a spot at
the bottom, and began peering and grubbing among the stones. In a
minute or two he cried out, and the rest followed; he had found a
spring, and by scraping in the gravel had made a tiny basin out of
which we could manage to drink a little. Here was a fresh cause of
delay: everybody was thirsty, and everybody must drink; not only
the water which, as we afterwards saw, trickled down hither under
the stones from a snow-bed seven hundred feet higher, but the water
mixed with some whisky from a flask my friend carried, which even
in this highly diluted state the Cossacks took to heartily. When at
last we got them up and away again, they began to waddle and
strangle; after a while two or three sat down, and plainly gave us
to see they would go no farther. By the time we had reached a
little snow-bed whence the now strong sun was drawing a stream of
water, and halted on the rocks beside it for breakfast, there were
only two Cossacks and the four Kurds left with us, the rest having
scattered themselves about somewhere lower down. We had no idea
what instructions they had received, nor whether indeed they had
been told anything except to bring us as far as they could, to see
that the Kurds brought the baggage, and to fetch us back again,
which last was essential for Jaafar's peace of mind. We concluded
therefore that if left to themselves they would probably wait our
return; and the day was running on so fast that it was clear there
was no more time to be lost in trying to drag them along with
us.</p>
<p>Accordingly I resolved to take what I wanted in the way of food,
and start at my own pace. My friend, who carried more weight, and
had felt the want of training on our way up, decided to come no
farther, but wait about here, and look out for me towards
nightfall. We noted the landmarks carefully,--the little snow-bed,
the head of the glen covered with reddish masses of stone and
gravel; and high above it, standing out of the face of the great
cone of Ararat, a bold peak or rather projecting tooth of black
rock, which our Cossacks called the Monastery, and which, I suppose
from the same fancied resemblance to a building, is said to be
called in Tatar Tach Kilissa, "the church rock." It is doubtless an
old cone of eruption, about thirteen thousand feet in height, and
is really the upper end of the long ridge we had been following,
which may perhaps represent a lava flow from it, or the edge of a
fissure which at this point found a vent.</p>
<p>It was an odd position to be in: guides of two different races,
unable to communicate either with us or with one another: guides
who could not lead and would not follow; guides one-half of whom
were supposed to be there to save us from being robbed and murdered
by the other half, but all of whom, I am bound to say, looked for
the moment equally simple and friendly, the swarthy Iranian as well
as the blue-eyed Slav.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock I buckled on my canvas gaiters, thrust some
crusts of bread, a lemon, a small flask of cold tea, four
hard-boiled eggs, and a few meat lozenges into my pocket, bade
good-by to my friend, and set off. Rather to our surprise, the two
Cossacks and one of the Kurds came with me, whether persuaded by a
pantomime of encouraging signs, or simply curious to see what would
happen. The ice-axe had hugely amused the Cossacks all through.
Climbing the ridge to the left, and keeping along its top for a
little way, I then struck across the semi-circular head of a wide
glen, in the middle of which, a little lower, lay a snow-bed over a
long steep slope of loose broken stones and sand. This slope, a
sort of talus or "screen" as they say in the Lake country, was
excessively fatiguing from the want of firm foothold; and when I
reached the other side, I was already so tired and breathless,
having been on foot since midnight, that it seemed almost useless
to persevere farther. However, on the other side I got upon solid
rock, where the walking was better, and was soon environed by a
multitude of rills bubbling down over the stones from the
stone-slopes above. The summit of Little Ararat, which had for the
last two hours provokingly kept at the same apparent height above
me, began to sink, and before ten o'clock I could look down upon
its small flat top, studded with lumps of rock, but bearing no
trace of a crater. Mounting steadily along the same ridge, I saw at
a height of over thirteen thousand feet, lying on the loose blocks,
a piece of wood about four feet long and five inches thick,
evidently cut by some tool, and so far above the limit of trees
that it could by no possibility be a natural fragment of one.
Darting on it with a glee that astonished the Cossack and the Kurd,
I held it up to them, and repeated several times the word "Noah."
The Cossack grinned; but he was such a cheery, genial fellow that I
think he would have grinned whatever I had said, and I cannot be
sure that he took my meaning, and recognized the wood as a fragment
of the true Ark. Whether it was really gopher wood, of which
material the Ark was built, I will not undertake to say, but am
willing to submit to the inspection of the curious the bit which I
cut off with my ice-axe and brought away. Anyhow, it will be hard
to prove that it is not gopher wood. And if there be any remains of
the Ark on Ararat at all,--a point as to which the natives are
perfectly clear,--here rather than the top is the place where one
might expect to find them, since in the course of ages they would
get carried down by the onward movement of the snow-beds along the
declivities. This wood, therefore, suits all the requirements of
the case. In fact, the argument is for the case of a relic
exceptionally strong: the Crusaders who found the Holy Lance at
Antioch, the archbishop who recognized the Holy Coat at Treves, not
to speak of many others, proceeded upon slighter evidence. I am,
however, bound to admit that another explanation of the presence of
this piece of timber on the rocks of this vast height did occur to
me. But as no man is bound to discredit his own relic, and such is
certainly not the practice of the Armenian Church, I will not
disturb my readers' minds or yield to the rationalizing tendencies
of the age by suggesting it.</p>
<p>Fearing that the ridge by which we were mounting would become
too precipitous higher up, I turned off to the left, and crossed a
long, narrow snow-slope that descended between this ridge and
another line of rocks more to the west. It was firm, and just steep
enough to make steps cut in the snow comfortable, though not
necessary; so the ice-axe was brought into use. The Cossack who
accompanied me--there was but one now, for the other Cossack had
gone away to the right some time before, and was quite lost to
view--had brought my friend's alpenstock, and was developing a
considerable capacity for wielding it. He followed nimbly across;
but the Kurd stopped on the edge of the snow, and stood peering and
hesitating, like one who shivers on the plank at a bathing-place,
nor could the jeering cries of the Cossack induce him to venture on
the treacherous surface. Meanwhile, we who had crossed were
examining the broken cliff which rose above us. It looked not
exactly dangerous, but a little troublesome, as if it might want
some care to get over or through. So after a short rest I stood up,
touched my Cossack's arm, and pointed upward. He reconnoitred the
cliff with his eye, and shook his head. Then, with various gestures
of hopefulness, I clapped him on the back, and made as though to
pull him along. He looked at the rocks again and pointed, to them,
stroked his knees, turned up and pointed to the soles of his boots,
which certainly were suffering from the lava, and once more
solemnly shook his head. This was conclusive: so I conveyed to him
my pantomime that he had better go back to the bivouac where my
friend was, rather than remain here alone, and that I hoped to meet
him there in the evening; took an affectionate farewell, and turned
towards the rocks. There was evidently nothing for it but to go on
alone. It was half-past ten o'clock, and the height about thirteen
thousand six hundred feet, Little Ararat now lying nearly one
thousand feet below the eye.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Not knowing how far the ridge I was following might continue
passable, I was obliged to stop frequently to survey the rocks
above, and erect little piles of stone to mark the way. This not
only consumed time, but so completely absorbed the attention that
for hours together I scarcely noticed the marvelous landscape
spread out beneath, and felt the solemn grandeur of the scenery far
less than many times before on less striking mountains. Solitude at
great heights, or among majestic rocks or forests, commonly stirs
in us all deep veins of feeling, joyous or saddening, or more often
of joy and sadness mingled. Here the strain on the observing senses
seemed too great for fancy or emotion to have any scope. When the
mind is preocupied by the task of the moment, imagination is
checked. This was a race against time, in which I could only scan
the cliffs for a route, refer constantly to the watch, husband my
strength by morsels of food taken at frequent intervals, and
endeavor to conceive how a particular block or bit of slope which
it would be necessary to recognize would look when seen the other
way in descending....</p>
<p>All the way up this rock-slope, which proved so fatiguing that
for the fourth time I had almost given up hope, I kept my eye fixed
on its upper end to see what signs there were of crags or
snow-fields above. But the mist lay steadily at the point where the
snow seemed to begin, and it was impossible to say what might be
hidden behind that soft white curtain. As little could I conjecture
the height I had reached by looking around, as one so often does on
mountain ascents, upon other summits; for by this time I was
thousands of feet above Little Ararat, the next highest peak
visible, and could scarcely guess how many thousands. From this
tremendous height it looked more like a broken obelisk than an
independent summit twelve thousand eight hundred feet in height.
Clouds covered the farther side of the great snow basin, and were
seething like waves about the savage pinnacles, the towers of the
Jinn palace, which guard its lower margin, and past which my upward
path had lain. With mists to the left and above, and a range of
black precipices cutting off all view to the right, there came a
vehement sense of isolation and solitude, and I began to understand
better the awe with which the mountain silence inspires the Kurdish
shepherds. Overhead the sky had turned from dark blue to an intense
bright green, a color whose strangeness seemed to add to the weird
terror of the scene. It wanted barely an hour to the time when I
had resolved to turn back; and as I struggled up the crumbling
rocks, trying now to right and now to left, where the foothold
looked a little firmer, I began to doubt whether there was strength
enough left to carry me an hour higher. At length the rock-slope
came suddenly to an end, and I stepped out upon the almost level
snow at the top of it, coming at the same time into the clouds,
which naturally clung to the colder surfaces. A violent west wind
was blowing, and the temperature must have been pretty low, for a
big icicle at once enveloped the lower half of my face, and did not
melt till I got to the bottom of the cone four hours afterwards.
Unluckily I was very thinly clad, the stout tweed coat reserved for
such occasions having been stolen on a Russian railway. The only
expedient to be tried against the piercing cold was to tighten in
my loose light coat by winding around the waist a Spanish
<i>faja</i>, or scarf, which I had brought up to use in case of
need as a neck wrapper. Its bright purple looked odd enough in such
surroundings, but as there was nobody there to notice, appearances
did not much matter. In the mist, which was now thick, the eye
could pierce only some thirty yards ahead; so I walked on over the
snow five or six minutes, following the rise of its surface, which
was gentle, and fancying there might still be a good long way to
go. To mark the backward track I trailed the point of the ice-axe
along behind me in the soft snow, for there was no longer any
landmark; all was cloud on every side. Suddenly to my astonishment
the ground began to fall away to the north; I stopped; a puff of
wind drove off the mists on one side, the opposite side to that by
which I had come, and showed the Araxes plain at an abysmal depth
below. It was the top of Ararat.</p>

<h3>THE WORK OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE</h3>
<center>From 'The Holy Roman Empire'</center>
<br>
<p>No one who reads the history of the last three hundred years--no
one, above all, who studies attentively the career of Napoleon--can
believe it possible for any State, however great her energy and
material resources, to repeat in modern Europe the part of ancient
Rome; to gather into one vast political body races whose national
individuality has grown more and more marked in each successive
age. Nevertheless, it is in great measure due to Rome and to the
Roman Empire of the Middle Ages that the bonds of national union
are on the whole both stronger and nobler than they were ever
before. The latest historian of Rome [Mommsen], after summing up
the results to the world of his hero's career, closes his treatise
with these words:</p>
<blockquote>"There was in the world as C&aelig;sar found it the
rich and noble heritage of past centuries, and an endless abundance
of splendor and glory; but little soul, still less taste, and least
of all, joy in and through life. Truly it was an old world, and
even C&aelig;sar's genial patriotism could not make it young again.
The blush of dawn returns not until the night has fully descended.
Yet with him there came to the much-tormented races of the
Mediterranean a tranquil evening after a sultry day; and when after
long historical night the new day broke once more upon the peoples,
and fresh nations in free self-guided movement began their course
toward new and higher aims, many were found among them in whom the
seed of C&aelig;sar had sprung up,--many who owed him, and who owe
him still, their national individuality."</blockquote>
<p>If this be the glory of Julius, the first great founder of the
Empire, so is it also the glory of Charles, the second founder, and
of more than one among his Teutonic successors. The work of the
medi&aelig;val Empire was self-destructive; and it fostered, while
seeming to oppose, the nationalities that were destined to replace
it. It tamed the barbarous races of the North and forced them
within the pale of civilization. It preserved the arts and
literature of antiquity. In times of violence and oppression, it
set before its subjects the duty of rational obedience to an
authority whose watchwords were peace and religion. It kept alive,
when national hatreds were most bitter, the notion of a great
European Commonwealth. And by doing all this, it was in effect
abolishing the need for a centralizing and despotic power like
itself; it was making men capable of using national independence
aright; it was teaching them to rise to that conception of
spontaneous activity, and a freedom which is above law but not
against it, to which national independence itself, if it is to be a
blessing at all, must be only a means. Those who mark what has been
the tendency of events since A.D. 1789, and who remember how many
of the crimes and calamities of the past are still but half
redressed, need not be surprised to see the so-called principle of
nationalities advocated with honest devotion as the final and
perfect form of political development. But such undistinguishing
advocacy is after all only the old error in a new shape. If all
other history did not bid us beware the habit of taking the
problems and the conditions of our own age for those of all time,
the warning which the Empire gives might alone be warning enough.
From the days of Augustus down to those of Charles V., the whole
civilized world believed in its existence as a part of the eternal
fitness of things, and Christian theologians were not behind
heathen poets in declaring that when it perished the world would
perish with it. Yet the Empire is gone, and the world remains, and
hardly notes the change.</p>

<h2>FRANCIS TREVELYAN BUCKLAND</h2>
<h3>(1826-1880)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-c.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ertainly, among the most useful of writers are the popularizers
of science; those who can describe in readable, picturesque fashion
those wonders and innumerable inhabitants of the world which the
Dryasdusts discover, but which are apt to escape the attention of
idlers or of the busy workers in other fields. Sometimes--not
often--the same man unites the capacities of a patient and accurate
investigator and of an accomplished narrator. To such men the field
of enjoyment is boundless, as is the opportunity to promote the
enjoyment of others.</p>
<p>One of these two-sided men was Francis Trevelyan Buckland,
popularly known as "Frank" Buckland, and so called in some of his
books. His father, William Buckland,--at the time of the son's
birth canon of Christ College, Oxford, and subsequently Dean of
Westminster,--was the well-known geologist. As the father's life
was devoted to the study of the inorganic, so that of the son was
absorbed in the investigation of the organic world. He never tired
of watching the habits of living creatures of all kinds; he lived
as it were in a menagerie and it is related that his numerous
callers were accustomed to the most familiar and impertinent
demonstrations on the part of his monkeys and various other pets.
He was an expert salmon-fisher, and his actual specialty was
fishes; but he could not have these about him so conveniently as
some other forms of life, and he extended his studies and specimens
widely beyond ichthyology.</p>
<p>Buckland was born December 17th, 1826, and died December 19th,
1880. Brought up in a scientific atmosphere, he was all his life
interested in the same subjects. Educated as a physician and
surgeon and distinguished for his anatomical skill, his training
fitted him for the careful investigation which is necessary on the
part of the biologist. He was fortunate too in receiving in early
middle life the government appointment of Inspector of Salmon
Fisheries, and so being enabled to devote himself wholly to his
favorite pursuits. In this position he was unwearied in his efforts
to develop pisciculture, and to improve the apparatus used by the
fishermen, interesting himself also in the condition of themselves
and their families.</p>
<p>He was always writing. He was a very frequent contributor to The
Field from its foundation in 1856, and subsequently to Land and
Water, a periodical which he started in 1866, and to other
periodicals. He published a number of volumes, made up in great
part from his contributions to periodicals, most of them of a
popular character and full of interesting information. Among those
which are best known are the 'Curiosities of Natural History'
(1857-72); the 'Log-Book of a Fisherman and Geologist' (1875); a
'Natural History of British Fishes' (1881); and 'Notes and Jottings
from Animal Life,' which was not issued until 1882, though the
material was selected by himself.</p>
<p>Buckland was of a jovial disposition, and always sure to see the
humorous side of the facts which were presented to him; and in his
social life he was extremely unconventional, and inclined to merry
pranks. His books are as delightful as was their writer. They are
records of accurate, useful, eye-opening details as to fauna, all
the world over. They are written with a brisk, sincere informality
that suggest the lively talker rather than the writer. He takes us
a-walking in green lanes and woods, and a-wading in brooks and
still pools--not drawing us into a class-room or a study. He enters
into the heart and life of creatures, and shows us how we should do
the same. A lively humor is in all his popular pages. He instructs
while smiling; and he is a savant while a light-hearted friend. Few
English naturalists are as genial--not even White of Selborne--and
few as wide in didactics. To know him is a profit indeed; but just
as surely a pleasure.</p>

<h3>A HUNT IN A HORSE-POND</h3>
<center>From 'Curiosities of Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>Well, let us have a look at the pond-world; choose a dry place
at the side, and fix our eyes steadily upon the dirty water: what
shall we see? Nothing at first; but wait a minute or two: a little
round black knob appears in the middle; gradually it rises higher
and higher, till at last you can make out a frog's head, with his
great eyes staring hard at you, like the eyes of the frog in the
woodcut facing &AElig;sop's fable of the frog and the bull. Not a
bit of his body do you see: he is much too cunning for that; he
does not know who or what you are; you may be a heron, his mortal
enemy, for aught he knows. You move your arm: he thinks it is the
heron's bill coming; down he goes again, and you see him not: a few
seconds, he regains courage and reappears, having probably
communicated the intelligence to the other frogs; for many big
heads and many big eyes appear, in all parts of the pond, looking
like so many hippopotami on a small scale. Soon a conversational
"Wurk; wurk, wurk," begins: you don't understand it; luckily,
perhaps, as from the swelling in their throats it is evident that
the colony is outraged by the intrusion, and the remarks passing
are not complimentary to the intruder. These frogs are all
respectable, grown-up, well-to-do frogs, and they have in this pond
duly deposited their spawn, and then, hard-hearted creatures! left
it to its fate; it has, however, taken care of itself, and is now
hatched, at least that part of it which has escaped the hands of
the gipsies, who not unfrequently prescribe baths of this natural
jelly for rheumatism....</p>
<p>In some places, from their making this peculiar noise, frogs
have been called "Dutch nightingales." In Scotland, too, they have
a curious name, Paddock or Puddick; but there is poetical authority
for it:--</p>
<blockquote>"The water-snake whom fish and paddocks feed,<br>
With staring scales lies poisoned."--DRYDEN.</blockquote>
<p>Returning from the University of Giessen, I brought with me
about a dozen green tree-frogs, which I had caught in the woods
near the town. The Germans call them <i>laub-frosch,</i> or
leaf-frog; they are most difficult things to find, on account of
their color so much resembling the leaves on which they live. I
have frequently heard one singing in a small bush, and though I
have searched carefully, have not been able to find him: the only
way is to remain quite quiet till he again begins his song. After
much ambush-work, at length I collected a dozen frogs and put them
in a bottle. I started at night on my homeward journey by the
diligence, and I put the bottle containing the frogs into the
pocket inside the diligence. My fellow-passengers were sleepy old
smoke-dried Germans: very little conversation took place, and after
the first mile every one settled himself to sleep, and soon all
were snoring. I suddenly awoke with a start, and found all the
sleepers had been roused at the same moment. On their sleepy faces
were depicted fear and anger. What had woke us all up so suddenly?
The morning was just breaking, and my frogs, though in the dark
pocket of the coach, had found it out; and with one accord, all
twelve of them had begun their morning song. As if at a given
signal, they one and all of them began to croak as loud as ever
they could. The noise their united concert made, seemed, in the
closed compartment of the coach, quite deafening. Well might the
Germans look angry: they wanted to throw the frogs, bottle and all,
out of the window; but I gave the bottle a good shaking, and made
the frogs keep quiet. The Germans all went to sleep again, but I
was obliged to remain awake, to shake the frogs when they began to
croak. It was lucky that I did so, for they tried to begin their
concert again two or three times. These frogs came safely to
Oxford; and the day after their arrival, a stupid housemaid took
off the top of the bottle to see what was inside; one of the frogs
croaked at that instant, and so frightened her that she dared not
put the cover on again. They all got loose in the garden, where I
believe the ducks ate them, for I never heard or saw them
again.</p>

<h3>ON RATS</h3>
<center>From 'Curiosities of Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>On one occasion, when a boy, I recollect secretly borrowing an
old-fashioned flint gun from the bird-keeper of the farm to which I
had been invited. I ensconced myself behind the door of the
pig-sty, determined to make a victim of one of the many rats that
were accustomed to disport themselves among the straw that formed
the bed of the farmer's pet bacon-pigs. In a few minutes out came
an old patriarchal-looking rat, who, having taken a careful survey,
quietly began to feed. After a long aim, bang went the gun--I fell
backwards, knocked down by the recoil of the rusty old piece of
artillery. I did not remain prone long, for I was soon roused by
the most unearthly squeaks, and a dreadful noise as of an
infuriated animal madly rushing round and round the sty. Ye gods!
what had I done? I had not surely, like the tailor in the old song
of the 'Carrion Crow,'</p>
<blockquote>"Shot and missed my mark,<br>
And shot the old sow right bang through the heart."</blockquote>
<p>But I had nearly performed a similar sportsman-like feat. There
was poor piggy, the blood flowing in streamlets from several small
punctures in that part of his body destined, at no very distant
period, to become ham; in vain attempting, by dismal cries and by
energetic waggings of his curly tail, to appease the pain of the
charge of small shot which had so unceremoniously awaked him from
his porcine dreams of oatmeal and boiled potatoes. But where was
the rat? He had disappeared unhurt; the buttocks of the unfortunate
pig, the rightful owner of the premises, had received the charge of
shot intended to destroy the daring intruder.</p>
<p>To appease piggy's wrath I gave him a bucketful of food from the
hog-tub; and while he was thus consoling his inward self, wiped off
the blood from the wounded parts, and said nothing about it to
anybody. No doubt, before this time, some frugal housewife has been
puzzled and astonished at the unwonted appearance of a charge of
small shot in the centre of the breakfast ham which she procured
from Squire Morland, of Sheepstead, Berks.</p>
<p>Rats are very fond of warmth, and will remain coiled up for
hours in any snug retreat where they can find this very necessary
element of their existence. The following anecdote well illustrates
this point:--</p>
<p>My late father, when fellow of Corpus College, Oxford, many
years ago, on arriving at his rooms late one night, found that a
rat was running about among the books and geological specimens,
behind the sofa, under the fender, and poking his nose into every
hiding-place he could find. Being studiously inclined, and wishing
to set to work at his books, he pursued him, armed with the poker
in one hand, and a large dictionary, big enough to crush any rat,
in the other; but in vain; Mr. Rat was not to be caught,
particularly when such "arma scholastica" were used.</p>
<p>No sooner had the studies recommenced than the rat resumed his
gambols, squeaking and rushing about the room like a mad creature.
The battle was renewed, and continued at intervals, to the
destruction of all studies, till quite a late hour at night, when
the pursuer, angry and wearied, retired to his adjoining bedroom;
though he listened attentively he heard no more of the enemy, and
soon fell asleep. In the morning he was astonished to find
something warm lying on his chest; carefully lifting up the
bed-clothes, he discovered his tormentor of the preceding night
quietly and snugly ensconced in a fold in the blanket, and taking
advantage of the bodily warmth of his two-legged adversary. These
two lay looking daggers at each other for some minutes, the one
unwilling to leave his warm berth, the other afraid to put his hand
out from under the protection of the coverlid, particularly as the
stranger's aspect was anything but friendly, his little sharp teeth
and fierce little black eyes seeming to say, "Paws off from me, if
you please!"</p>
<p>At length, remembering the maxim that "discretion is the better
part of valor"--the truth of which, I imagine, rats understand as
well as most creatures,--he made a sudden jump off the bed,
scuttled away into the next room, and was never seen or heard of
afterwards....</p>
<p>Rats are not selfish animals: having found out where the feast
is stored, they will kindly communicate the intelligence to their
friends and neighbors. The following anecdote will confirm this
fact. A certain worthy old lady named Mrs. Oke, who resided at
Axminster several years ago, made a cask of sweet wine, for which
she was celebrated, and carefully placed it on a shelf in the
cellar. The second night after this event she was frightened almost
to death by a strange unaccountable noise in the said cellar. The
household was called up and a search made, but nothing was found to
clear up the mystery. The next night, as soon as the lights were
extinguished and the house quiet, this dreadful noise was heard
again. This time it was most alarming: a sound of squeaking,
crying, knocking, pattering feet; then a dull scratching sound,
with many other such ghostly noises, which continued throughout the
livelong night. The old lady lay in bed with the candle alight,
pale and sleepless with fright, anon muttering her prayers, anon
determined to fire off the rusty old blunderbuss that hung over the
chimneypiece. At last the morning broke, and the cock began to
crow. "Now," thought she, "the ghosts must disappear." To her
infinite relief, the noise really did cease, and the poor
frightened dame adjusted her nightcap and fell asleep. Great
preparations had she made for the next night; farm servants armed
with pitchforks slept in the house; the maids took the family
dinner-bell and the tinder-box into their rooms; the big dog was
tied to the hall-table. Then the dame retired to her room, not to
sleep, but to sit up in the arm-chair by the fire, keeping a drowsy
guard over the neighbor's loaded horse-pistols, of which she was
almost as much afraid as she was of the ghost in the cellar. Sure
enough, her warlike preparations had succeeded; the ghost was
certainly frightened; not a noise, not a sound, except the heavy
snoring of the bumpkins and the rattling of the dog's chain in the
hall, could be heard. She had gained a complete victory; the ghost
was never heard again on the premises, and the whole affair was
soon forgotten. Some weeks afterward some friends dropped in to
take a cup of tea and talk over the last piece of gossip. Among
other things the wine was mentioned, and the maid sent to get some
from the cellar. She soon returned, and gasping for breath, rushed
into the room, exclaiming, "'Tis all gone, ma'am;" and sure enough
it was all gone. "The ghost has taken it"--not a drop was left,
only the empty cask remained; the side was half eaten away, and
marks of sharp teeth were visible round the ragged margins of the
newly made bungholes.</p>
<p>This discovery fully accounted for the noise the ghost had made,
which caused so much alarm. The aboriginal rats in the dame's
cellar had found out the wine, and communicated the joyful news to
all the other rats in the parish; they had assembled there to enjoy
the fun, and get very tipsy (which, judging from the noise they
made, they certainly did) on this treasured cask of wine. Being
quite a family party, they had finished it in two nights; and
having got all they could, like wise rats they returned to their
respective homes, perfectly unconscious that their merry-making had
nearly been the death of the rightful owner and "founder of the
feast." They had first gnawed out the cork, and got as much as they
could: they soon found that the more they drank the lower the wine
became. Perseverance is the motto of the rat; so they set to work
and ate away the wood to the level of the wine again. This they
continued till they had emptied the cask; they must then have got
into it and licked up the last drains, for another and less
agreeable smell was substituted for that of wine. I may add that
this cask, with the side gone, and the marks of the rats' teeth, is
still in my possession.</p>

<h3>SNAKES AND THEIR POISON</h3>
<center>From 'Curiosities of Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>Be it known to any person to whose lot it should fall to rescue
a person from the crushing folds of a boa-constrictor, that it is
no use pulling and hauling at the centre of the brute's body; catch
hold of the tip of his tail,--he can then be easily unwound,--he
cannot help himself;--he "must" come off. Again, if you wish to
kill a snake, it is no use hitting and trying to crush his head.
The bones of the head are composed of the densest material,
affording effectual protection to the brain underneath: a wise
provision for the animal's preservation; for were his skull
brittle, his habit of crawling on the ground would render it very
liable to be fractured. The spinal cord runs down the entire length
of the body; this being wounded, the animal is disabled or killed
instanter. Strike therefore his tail, and not his head; for at his
tail the spinal cord is but thinly covered with bone, and suffers
readily from injury. This practice is applicable to eels. If you
want to kill an eel, it is not much use belaboring his head:
strike, however, his tail two or three times against any hard
substance, and he is quickly dead.</p>
<p>About four years ago I myself, in person, had painful experience
of the awful effects of snake's poison. I have received a dose of
the cobra's poison into my system; luckily a minute dose, or I
should not have survived it. The accident happened in a very
curious way. I was poisoned by the snake but not bitten by him. I
got the poison second-hand. Anxious to witness the effects of the
poison of the cobra upon a rat, I took up a couple in a bag alive
to a certain cobra. I took one rat out of the bag and put him into
the cage with the snake. The cobra was coiled up among the stones
in the centre of the cage, apparently asleep. When he heard the
noise of the rat falling into the cage, he just looked up and put
out his tongue, hissing at the same time. The rat got in a corner
and began washing himself, keeping one eye on the snake, whose
appearance he evidently did not half like. Presently the rat ran
across the snake's body, and in an instant the latter assumed his
fighting attitude. As the rat passed the snake, he made a dart, but
missing his aim, hit his nose a pretty hard blow against the side
of the cage. This accident seemed to anger him, for he spread out
his crest and waved it to and fro in the beautiful manner peculiar
to his kind. The rat became alarmed and ran near him again. Again
cobra made a dart, and bit him, but did not, I think, inject any
poison into him, the rat being so very active; at least, no
symptoms of poisoning were shown. The bite nevertheless aroused the
ire of the rat, for he gathered himself for a spring, and measuring
his distance, sprang right on to the neck of the cobra, who was
waving about in front of him. This plucky rat, determined to die
hard, gave the cobra two or three severe bites in the neck, the
snake keeping his body erect all this time, and endeavoring to turn
his head round so as to bite the rat who was clinging on like the
old man in 'Sindbad the Sailor.' Soon, however, cobra changed his
tactics. Tired, possibly, with sustaining the weight of the rat, he
lowered his head, and the rat, finding himself again on terra
firma, tried to run away: not so; for the snake, collecting all his
force, brought down his erected poison-fangs, making his head tell
by its weight in giving vigor to the blow, right on to the body of
the rat.</p>
<p>This poor beast now seemed to know that the fight was over and
that he was conquered. He retired to a corner of the cage and began
panting violently, endeavoring at the same time to steady his
failing strength with his feet. His eyes were widely dilated, and
his mouth open as if gasping for breath. The cobra stood erect over
him, hissing and putting out his tongue as if conscious of victory.
In about three minutes the rat fell quietly on his side and
expired; the cobra then moved off and took no further notice of his
defunct enemy. About ten minutes afterward the rat was hooked out
of the cage for me to examine. No external wound could I see
anywhere, so I took out my knife and began taking the skin off the
rat. I soon discovered two very minute punctures, like small
needle-holes, in the side of the rat, where the fangs of the snake
had entered. The parts between the skin and the flesh, and the
flesh itself, appeared as though affected with mortification, even
though the wound had not been inflicted above a quarter of an hour,
if so much.</p>
<p>Anxious to see if the skin itself was affected, I scraped away
the parts on it with my finger-nail. Finding nothing but the
punctures, I threw the rat away and put the knife and skin in my
pocket, and started to go away. I had not walked a hundred yards
before all of a sudden I felt just as if somebody had come behind
me and struck me a severe blow on the head and neck, and at the
same time I experienced a most acute pain and sense of oppression
at the chest, as though a hot iron had been run in and a
hundred-weight put on the top of it. I knew instantly, from what I
had read, that I was poisoned; I said as much to my friend, a most
intelligent gentleman, who happened to be with me, and told him if
I fell to give me brandy and "eau de luce," words which he kept
repeating in case he might forget them. At the same time I enjoined
him to keep me going, and not on any account to allow me to lie
down.</p>
<p>I then forgot everything for several minutes, and my friend
tells me I rolled about as if very faint and weak. He also informs
me that the first thing I did was to fall against him, asking if I
looked seedy. He most wisely answered, "No, you look very well." I
don't think he thought so, for his own face was as white as a
ghost; I recollect this much. He tells me my face was of a
greenish-yellow color. After walking or rather staggering along for
some minutes, I gradually recovered my senses and steered for the
nearest chemist's shop. Rushing in, I asked for eau de luce. Of
course he had none, but my eye caught the words "Spirit, ammon.
co.," or hartshorn, on a bottle. I reached it down myself, and
pouring a large quantity into a tumbler with a little water, both
of which articles I found on a soda-water stand in the shop, drank
it off, though it burnt my mouth and lips very much. Instantly I
felt relief from the pain at the chest and head. The chemist stood
aghast, and on my telling him what was the matter, recommended a
warm bath. If I had then followed his advice these words would
never have been placed on record. After a second draught at the
hartshorn bottle, I proceeded on my way, feeling very stupid and
confused. On arriving at my friend's residence close by, he kindly
procured me a bottle of brandy, of which I drank four large
wine-glasses one after the other, but did not feel the least tipsy
after the operation. Feeling nearly well, I started on my way home,
and then for the first time perceived a most acute pain under the
nail of the left thumb: this pain also ran up the arm. I set to
work to suck the wound, and then found out how the poison had got
into the system. About an hour before I examined the dead rat I had
been cleaning the nail with a penknife, and had slightly separated
the nail from the skin beneath. Into this little crack the poison
had got when I was scraping the rat's skin to examine the wound.
How virulent, therefore, must the poison of the cobra be! It had
already been circulated in the body of the rat, from which I had
imbibed it second-hand!</p>

<h3>MY MONKEY JACKO</h3>
<center>From 'Curiosities of Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>After some considerable amount of bargaining (in which amusing,
sometimes animated, not to say exciting exhibition of talent,
Englishmen generally get worsted by the Frenchmen, as was the case
in the present instance), Jacko became transferred, chain, tail and
all, to his new English master. Having arrived at the hotel, it
became a question as to what was to become of Jacko while his
master was absent from home. A little closet, opening into the wall
of the bedroom, offered itself as a temporary prison. Jacko was
tied up <i>securely</i>--alas! how vain are the thoughts of
man!--to one of the row of pegs that were fastened against the
wall. As the door closed on him his wicked eyes seemed to say,
"I'll do some mischief now;" and sure enough he did, for when I
came back to release him, like &AElig;neas,</p>
<blockquote>"Obstupni, steteruntque com&aelig; et vox fancibus
h&aelig;sit<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5">[5]</a>."</blockquote>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor5">[5]</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Aghast, astonished, and struck dumb
with fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood; like bristles rose my
stiffened hair."--DRYDEN.</blockquote>
<p>The walls, that but half an hour previously were covered with a
finely ornamented paper, now stood out in the bold nakedness of
lath and plaster; the relics on the floor showed that the little
wretch's fingers had by no means been idle. The pegs were all
loosened, the individual peg to which his chain had been fastened,
torn completely from its socket, that the destroyer's movements
might not be impeded, and an unfortunate garment that happened to
be hung up in the closet was torn to a thousand shreds. If ever
Jack Sheppard had a successor, it was this monkey. If he had tied
the torn bits of petticoat together and tried to make his escape
from the window, I don't think I should have been much
surprised....</p>
<p>It was, after Jacko's misdeeds, quite evident that he must no
longer be allowed full liberty; and a lawyer's blue bag, such as
may be frequently seen in the dreaded neighborhood of the Court of
Chancery,--filled, however, more frequently with papers and
parchment than with monkeys,--was provided for him; and this
receptacle, with some hay placed at the bottom for a bed, became
his new abode. It was a movable home, and therein lay the
advantage; for when the strings of it were tied there was no mode
of escape. He could not get his hands through the aperture at the
end to unfasten them, the bag was too strong for him to bite his
way through, and his ineffectual efforts to get out only had the
effect of making the bag roll along the floor, and occasionally
make a jump up into the air; forming altogether an exhibition which
if advertised in the present day of wonders as "le bag vivant,"
would attract crowds of delighted and admiring citizens.</p>
<p>In the bag aforesaid he traveled as far as Southampton on his
road to town. While taking the ticket at the railway station,
Jacko, who must needs see everything that was going on, suddenly
poked his head out of the bag and gave a malicious grin at the
ticket-giver. This much frightened the poor man, but with great
presence of mind,--quite astonishing under the circumstances,--he
retaliated the insult: "Sir, that's a dog; you must pay for it
accordingly." In vain was the monkey made to come out of the bag
and exhibit his whole person; in vain were arguments in full
accordance with the views of Cuvier and Owen urged eagerly,
vehemently, and without hesitation (for the train was on the point
of starting), to prove that the animal in question was not a dog,
but a monkey. A dog it was in the peculiar views of the official,
and three-and-sixpence was paid. Thinking to carry the joke further
(there were just a few minutes to spare), I took out from my pocket
a live tortoise I happened to have with me, and showing it, said,
"What must I pay for this, as you charge for <i>all</i> animals?"
The employ&eacute; adjusted his specs, withdrew from the desk to
consult with his superior; then returning, gave the verdict with a
grave but determined manner, "No charge for them, sir: them be
insects."</p>

<h2>HENRY THOMAS BUCKLE</h2>
<h3>(1821-1862)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-h.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>enry Thomas Buckle was born at Lee, in Kent, on November 24th,
1821, the son of a wealthy London merchant. A delicate child, he
participated in none of the ordinary sports of children, but sat
instead for hours listening to his mother's reading of the Bible
and the 'Arabian Nights.' She had a great influence on his early
development. She was a Calvinist, deeply religious, and Buckle
himself in after years acknowledged that to her he owed his faith
in human progress through the dissemination and triumph of truth,
as well as his taste for philosophic speculations and his love for
poetry. His devotion to her was lifelong. Owing to his feeble
health he passed but a few years at school, and did not enter
college. Nor did he know much, in the scholar's sense, of books.
Till he was nearly eighteen the 'Arabian Nights,' the 'Pilgrim's
Progress' and Shakespeare constituted his chief reading.</p>
<p>But he was fond of games of mental skill, and curiously enough,
first gained distinction, not in letters but at the chessboard, and
in the course of his subsequent travels he challenged and defeated
the champions of Europe. He was concerned for a short time in
business; but being left with an independent income at the death of
his father, he resolved to devote himself to study. He traveled for
a year on the Continent, learning on the spot the languages of the
countries he passed through. In time he became an accomplished
linguist, reading nineteen languages and conversing fluently in
seven.</p>
<p>By the time he was nineteen he had resolved to write a great
historic work, of a nature not yet attempted by any one. To prepare
himself for this monumental labor, and to make up for past
deficiencies, he settled in London; and, apparently single-handed
and without the advice or help of tutors or professional men,
entered upon that course of voluminous reading on which his
erudition rests.</p>
<p>He is a singular instance of a self-taught man, without
scientific or academic training, producing a work that marks an
epoch in historical literature. With a wonderful memory, he had,
like Macaulay, the gift of getting the meaning and value of a book
by simply glancing over the pages. On an average he could read with
intelligent comprehension three books in a working day of eight
hours, and in time mastered his library of twenty-two thousand
volumes, indexing every book on the back, and transcribing many
pages into his commonplace-books. In this way he spent fifteen
years of study in collecting his materials.</p>
<p>The first volume of his introduction to the 'History of
Civilization in England' appeared in 1857, and aroused an
extraordinary interest because of the novelty and audacity of its
statements. It was both bitterly attacked and enthusiastically
praised, as it antagonized or attracted its readers. Buckle became
the intellectual hero of the hour. The second volume appeared in
May, 1861. And now, worn out by overwork, his delicate nerves
completely unstrung by the death of his mother, who had remained
his first and only love, he left England for the East, in company
with the two young sons of a friend. In Palestine he was stricken
with typhoid fever, and died at Damascus on May 29th, 1862. His
grave is marked by a marble tomb with the inscription from the
Arabic:--</p>
<blockquote>"The written word remains long after the writer;<br>
The writer is resting under the earth, but his works
endure."</blockquote>
<p>Three volumes of 'Miscellanies and Posthumous Works,' edited by
Helen Taylor, were published in 1872. Among these are a lecture on
'Woman,' delivered before the Royal Institution,--Buckle's single
and very successful attempt at public speaking,--and a Review of
Mill's 'Liberty,' one of the finest contemporary appreciations of
that thinker. But he wrote little outside his 'History,' devoting
himself with entire singleness of purpose to his life-work.</p>
<p>The introduction to the 'History of Civilization in England' has
been aptly called the "fragment of a fragment." When as a mere
youth he outlined his work, he overestimated the extremest
accomplishment of a single mind, and did not clearly comprehend the
vastness of the undertaking. He had planned a general history of
civilization; but as the material increased on his hands he was
forced to limit his project, and finally decided to confine his
work to a consideration of England from the middle of the sixteenth
century. In February, 1853, he wrote to a friend:--</p>
<blockquote>"I have been long convinced that the progress of every
people is regulated by principles--or as they are called, laws--as
regular and as certain as those which govern the physical world. To
discover these laws is the object of my work.... I propose to take
a general survey of the moral, intellectual, and legislative
peculiarities of the great countries of Europe; and I hope to point
out the circumstances under which these peculiarities have arisen.
This will lead to a perception of certain relations between the
various stages through which each people have progressively passed.
Of these <i>general</i> relations I intend to make a
<i>particular</i> application; and by a careful analysis of the
history of England, show how they have regulated our civilization,
and how the successive and apparently the arbitrary forms of our
opinions, our literature, our laws, and our manners, have naturally
grown out of their antecedents."</blockquote>
<p>This general scheme was adhered to in the published history, and
he supported his views by a vast array of illustrations and proofs.
The main ideas advanced in the Introduction--for he did not live to
write the body of the work, the future volumes to which he often
pathetically refers--these ideas may be thus stated:--First:
Nothing had yet been done toward discovering the principles
underlying the character and destiny of nations, to establish a
basis for a science of history,--a task which Buckle proposed to
himself. Second: Experience shows that nations are governed by laws
as fixed and regular as the laws of the physical world. Third:
Climate, soil, food, and the aspects of nature are the primary
causes in forming the character of a nation. Fourth: The
civilization within and without Europe is determined by the fact
that in Europe man is stronger than nature, and here alone has
subdued her to his service; whereas on the other continents nature
is the stronger and man has been subdued by her. Fifth: The
continually increasing influence of mental laws and the continually
diminishing influence of physical laws characterize the advance of
European civilization. Sixth: The mental laws regulating the
progress of society can only be discovered by such a comprehensive
survey of facts as will enable us to eliminate disturbances;
namely, by the method of averages. Seventh: Human progress is due
to intellectual activity, which continually changes and expands,
rather than to moral agencies, which from the beginnings of society
have been more or less stationary. Eighth: In human affairs in
general, individual efforts are insignificant, and great men work
for evil rather than for good, and are moreover merely incidental
to their age. Ninth: Religion, literature, art, and government
instead of being causes of civilization, are merely its products.
Tenth: The progress of civilization varies directly as
skepticism--the disposition to doubt, or the "protective
spirit"--the disposition to maintain without examination
established beliefs and practices, predominates.</p>
<p>The new scientific methods of Darwin and Mill were just then
being eagerly discussed in England; and Buckle, an alert student
and great admirer of Mill, in touch with the new movements of the
day, proposed, "by applying to the history of man those methods of
investigation which have been found successful in other branches of
knowledge, and rejecting all preconceived notions which could not
bear the test of those methods," to remove history from the
condemnation of being a mere series of arbitrary facts, or a
biography of famous men, or the small-beer chronicle of court
gossip and intrigues, and to raise it to the level of an exact
science, subject to mental laws as rigid and infallible as the laws
of nature:--</p>
<blockquote>"Instead of telling us of those things which alone have
any value--instead of giving us information respecting the progress
of knowledge and the way in which mankind has been affected by the
diffusion of that knowledge ... the vast majority of historians
fill their works with the most trifling and miserable details....
In other great branches of knowledge, observation has preceded
discovery; first the facts have been registered and then their laws
have been found. But in the study of the history of man, the
important facts have been neglected and the unimportant ones
preserved. The consequence is, that whoever now attempts to
generalize historical phenomena must collect the facts as well as
conduct the generalization."</blockquote>
<p>Buckle's ideal of the office and acquirements of the historian
was of the highest. He must indeed possess a synthesis of the whole
range of human knowledge to explain the progress of man. By
connecting history with political economy and statistics, he strove
to make it exact. And he exemplified his theories by taking up
branches of scientific investigation hitherto considered entirely
outside the province of the historian. He first wrote history
scientifically, pursuing the same methods and using the same kinds
of proofs as the scientific worker. The first volume excited as
much angry discussion as Darwin's 'Origin of Species' had done in
its day. The boldness of its generalizations, its uncompromising
and dogmatic tone, irritated more than one class of readers. The
chapters on Spain and on Scotland, with their strictures on the
religions of those countries, containing some of the most brilliant
passages in the book, brought up in arms against him both Catholics
and Presbyterians. Trained scientists blamed him for encroaching on
their domains with an insufficient knowledge of the phenomena of
the natural world, whence resulted a defective logic and vague
generalizations.</p>
<p>It is true that Buckle was not trained in the methods of the
schools; that he labored under the disadvantage of a self-taught,
solitary worker, not receiving the friction of other vigorous
minds; and that his reading, if extensive, was not always wisely
chosen, and from its very amount often ill-digested. He had
knowledge rather than true learning, and taking this knowledge at
second hand, often relied on sources that proved either
untrustworthy or antiquated, for he lacked the true relator's fine
discrimination, that weighs and sifts authorities and rejects the
inadequate. Malicious critics declared that all was grist that came
to his mill. Yet his popularity with that class of readers whom he
did not shock by his disquisitions on religions and morals, or make
distrustful by his sweeping generalizations and scientific
inaccuracies, is due to the fact that his book appeared at the
right moment: for the time was really come to make history
something more than a chronicle of detached facts and anecdotes.
The scientific spirit was awake, and demanded that human action,
like the processes of nature, be made the subject of general law.
The mind of Buckle proved fruitful soil for those germs of thought
floating in the air, and he gave them visible form in his history.
If he was not a leader, he was a brilliant formulator of thought,
and he was the first to put before the reading world, then ready to
receive them, ideas and speculations till now belonging to the
student. For he wrote with the determination to be intelligible to
the general reader. It detracts nothing from the permanent value of
his work thus to state its genesis, for this is merely to apply to
it his own methods.</p>
<p>Moreover, a perpetual charm lies in his clear, limpid English, a
medium perfectly adapted to calm exposition or to impassioned
rhetoric. Whatever the defects of Buckle's system: whatever the
inaccuracies that the advance of thirty years of patient scientific
labors can easily point out; however sweeping his generalization;
or however dogmatic his assertions, the book must be allowed high
rank among the works that set men thinking, and must thus be
conceded to possess enduring value.</p>

<h3>MORAL VERSUS INTELLECTUAL PRINCIPLES IN HUMAN PROGRESS</h3>
<center>From the 'History of Civilization in England'</center>
<br>
<p>There is unquestionably nothing to be found in the world which
has undergone so little change as those great dogmas of which moral
systems are composed. To do good to others; to sacrifice for their
benefit your own wishes; to love your neighbor as yourself; to
forgive your enemies; to restrain your passions; to honor your
parents; to respect those who are set over you,--these and a few
others are the sole essentials of morals: but they have been known
for thousands of years, and not one jot or tittle has been added to
them by all the sermons, homilies, and text-books which moralists
and theologians have been able to produce. But if we contrast this
stationary aspect of moral truths with the progressive aspect of
intellectual truths, the difference is indeed startling. All the
great moral systems which have exercised much influence have been
fundamentally the same; all the great intellectual systems have
been fundamentally different. In reference to our moral conduct,
there is not a single principle now known to the most cultivated
Europeans which was not likewise known to the ancients. In
reference to the conduct of our intellect, the moderns have not
only made the most important additions to every department of
knowledge that the ancients ever attempted to study, but besides
this they have upset and revolutionized the old methods of inquiry;
they have consolidated into one great scheme all those resources of
induction which Aristotle alone dimly perceived; and they have
created sciences, the faintest idea of which never entered the mind
of the boldest thinker antiquity produced.</p>
<p>These are, to every educated man, recognized and notorious
facts; and the inference to be drawn from them is immediately
obvious. Since civilization is the product of moral and
intellectual agencies, and since that product is constantly
changing, it evidently cannot be regulated by the stationary agent;
because, when surrounding circumstances are unchanged, a stationary
agent can only produce a stationary effect. The only other agent is
the intellectual one; and that this is the real mover may be proved
in two distinct ways: first because, being as we have already seen
either moral or intellectual, and being as we have also seen not
moral, it must be intellectual; and secondly, because the
intellectual principle has an activity and a capacity for
adaptation which, as I undertake to show, is quite sufficient to
account for the extraordinary progress that during several
centuries Europe has continued to make.</p>
<p>Such are the main arguments by which my view is supported; but
there are also other and collateral circumstances which are well
worthy of consideration. The first is, that the intellectual
principle is not only far more progressive than the moral
principle, but is also far more permanent in its results. The
acquisitions made by the intellect are, in every civilized country,
carefully preserved, registered in certain well-understood
formulas, and protected by the use of technical and scientific
language; they are easily handed down from one generation to
another, and thus assuming an accessible, or as it were a tangible
form, they often influence the most distant posterity, they become
the heirlooms of mankind, the immortal bequest of the genius to
which they owe their birth. But the good deeds effected by our
moral faculties are less capable of transmission; they are of a
more private and retiring character: while as the motives to which
they owe their origin are generally the result of self-discipline
and of self-sacrifice, they have to be worked out by every man for
himself; and thus, begun by each anew, they derive little benefit
from the maxims of preceding experience, nor can they well be
stored up for the use of future moralists. The consequence is that
although moral excellence is more amiable, and to most persons more
attractive, than intellectual excellence, still it must be
confessed that looking at ulterior results, it is far less active,
less permanent, and as I shall presently prove, less productive of
real good. Indeed, if we examine the effects of the most active
philanthropy and of the largest and most disinterested kindness, we
shall find that those effects are, comparatively speaking,
short-lived; that there is only a small number of individuals they
come in contact with and benefit; that they rarely survive the
generation which witnessed their commencement; and that when they
take the more durable form of founding great public charities, such
institutions invariably fall, first into abuse, then into decay,
and after a time are either destroyed or perverted from their
original intention, mocking the effort by which it is vainly
attempted to perpetuate the memory even of the purest and most
energetic benevolence.</p>
<p>These conclusions are no doubt very unpalatable; and what makes
them peculiarly offensive is, that it is impossible to refute them.
For the deeper we penetrate into this question, the more clearly
shall we see the superiority of intellectual acquisitions over
moral feeling. There is no instance on record of an ignorant man
who, having good intentions and supreme power to enforce them, has
not done far more evil than good. And whenever the intentions have
been very eager, and the power very extensive, the evil has been
enormous. But if you can diminish the sincerity of that man, if you
can mix some alloy with his motives, you will likewise diminish the
evil which he works. If he is selfish as well as ignorant, it will
often happen [that] you may play off his vice against his
ignorance, and by exciting his fears restrain his mischief. If,
however, he has no fear, if he is entirely unselfish, if his sole
object is the good of others, if he pursues that object with
enthusiasm, upon a large scale, and with disinterested zeal, then
it is that you have no check upon him, you have no means of
preventing the calamities which in an ignorant age an ignorant man
will be sure to inflict. How entirely this is verified by
experience, we may see in studying the history of religious
persecution. To punish even a single man for his religious tenets
is assuredly a crime of the deepest dye; but to punish a large body
of men, to persecute an entire sect, to attempt to extirpate
opinions which, growing out of the state of society in which they
arise, are themselves a manifestation of the marvelous and
luxuriant fertility of the human mind,--to do this is not only one
of the most pernicious, but one of the most foolish acts that can
possibly be conceived. Nevertheless it is an undoubted fact that an
overwhelming majority of religious persecutors have been men of the
purest intentions, of the most admirable and unsullied morals. It
is impossible that this should be otherwise. For they are not
bad-intentioned men who seek to enforce opinions which they believe
to be good. Still less are they bad men who are so regardless of
temporal considerations as to employ all the resources of their
power, not for their own benefit, but for the purpose of
propagating a religion which they think necessary to the future
happiness of mankind. Such men as these are not bad, they are only
ignorant; ignorant of the nature of truth, ignorant of the
consequences of their own acts. But in a moral point of view their
motives are unimpeachable. Indeed, it is the very ardor of their
sincerity which warms them into persecution. It is the holy zeal by
which they are fired that quickens their fanaticism into a deadly
activity. If you can impress any man with an absorbing conviction
of the supreme importance of some moral or religious doctrine; if
you can make him believe that those who reject that doctrine are
doomed to eternal perdition; if you then give that man power, and
by means of his ignorance blind him to the ulterior consequences of
his own act,--he will infallibly persecute those who deny his
doctrine; and the extent of his persecution will be regulated by
the extent of his sincerity. Diminish the sincerity, and you will
diminish the persecution; in other words, by weakening the virtue
you may check the evil. This is a truth of which history furnishes
such innumerable examples, that to deny it would be not only to
reject the plainest and most conclusive arguments, but to refuse
the concurrent testimony of every age. I will merely select two
cases, which, from the entire difference in their circumstances,
are very apposite as illustrations: the first being from the
history of Paganism, the other from the history of Christianity;
and both proving the inability of moral feelings to control
religious persecution.</p>
<p>I. The Roman emperors, as is well known, subjected the early
Christians to persecutions which, though they have been
exaggerated, were frequent and very grievous. But what to some
persons must appear extremely strange, is, that among the active
authors of these cruelties we find the names of the best men who
ever sat on the throne; while the worst and most infamous princes
were precisely those who spared the Christians, and took no heed of
their increase. The two most thoroughly depraved of all the
emperors were certainly Commodus and Elagabalus; neither of whom
persecuted the new religion, or indeed adopted any measures against
it. They were too reckless of the future, too selfish, too absorbed
in their own infamous pleasures, to mind whether truth or error
prevailed; and being thus indifferent to the welfare of their
subjects, they cared nothing about the progress of a creed which
they, as Pagan emperors, were bound to regard as a fatal and
impious delusion. They therefore allowed Christianity to run its
course, unchecked by those penal laws which more honest but more
mistaken rulers would assuredly have enacted. We find, accordingly,
that the great enemy of Christianity was Marcus Aurelius; a man of
kindly temper, and of fearless, unflinching honesty, but whose
reign was characterized by a persecution from which he would have
refrained had he been less in earnest about the religion of his
fathers. And to complete the argument, it may be added that the
last and one of the most strenuous opponents of Christianity who
occupied the throne of the C&aelig;sars was Julian; a prince of
eminent probity, whose opinions are often attacked, but against
whose moral conduct even calumny itself has hardly breathed a
suspicion.</p>
<p>II. The second illustration is supplied by Spain; a country of
which it must be confessed, that in no other have religiuos
feelings exercised such sway over the affairs of men. No other
European nation has produced so many ardent and disinterested
missionaries, zealous self-denying martyrs, who have cheerfully
sacrificed their lives in order to propagate truths which they
thought necessary to be known. Nowhere else have the spiritual
classes been so long in the ascendant; nowhere else are the people
so devout, the churches so crowded, the clergy so numerous. But the
sincerity and honesty of purpose by which the Spanish people, taken
as a whole, have always been marked, have not only been unable to
prevent religious persecution, but have proved the means of
encouraging it. If the nation had been more lukewarm, it would have
been more tolerant. As it was, the preservation of the faith became
the first consideration; and everything being sacrificed to this
one object, it naturally happened that zeal begat cruelty, and the
soil was prepared in which the Inquisition took root and
flourished. The supporters of that barbarous institution were not
hypocrites, but enthusiasts. Hypocrites are for the most part too
supple to be cruel. For cruelty is a stern and unbending passion;
while hypocrisy is a fawning and flexible art, which accommodates
itself to human feelings, and flatters the weakness of men in order
that it may gain its own ends. In Spain, the earnestness of the
nation, being concentrated on a single topic, carried everything
before it; and hatred of heresy becoming a habit, persecution of
heresy was thought a duty. The conscientious energy with which that
duty was fulfilled is seen in the history of the Spanish Church.
Indeed, that the inquisitors were remarkable for an undeviating and
uncorruptible integrity may be proved in a variety of ways, and
from different and independent sources of evidence. This is a
question to which I shall hereafter return; but there are two
testimonies which I cannot omit, because, from the circumstances
attending them, they are peculiarly unimpeachable. Llorente, the
great historian of the Inquisition, and its bitter enemy, had
access to its private papers: and yet, with the fullest means of
information, he does not even insinuate a charge against the moral
character of the inquisitors; but while execrating the cruelty of
their conduct, he cannot deny the purity of their intentions.
Thirty years earlier, Townsend, a clergyman of the Church of
England, published his valuable work on Spain: and though, as a
Protestant and an Englishman, he had every reason to be prejudiced
against the infamous system which he describes, he also can bring
no charge against those who upheld it; but having occasion to
mention its establishment at Barcelona, one of its most important
branches, he makes the remarkable admission that all its members
are men of worth, and that most of them are of distinguished
humanity.</p>
<p>These facts, startling as they are, form a very small part of
that vast mass of evidence which history contains, and which
decisively proves the utter inability of moral feelings to diminish
religious persecution. The way in which the diminution has been
really effected by the mere progress of intellectual acquirements
will be pointed out in another part of this volume; when we shall
see that the great antagonist of intolerance is not humanity, but
knowledge. It is to the diffusion of knowledge, and to that alone,
that we owe the comparative cessation of what is unquestionably the
greatest evil men have ever inflicted on their own species. For
that religious persecution is a greater evil than any other, is
apparent, not so much from the enormous and almost incredible
number of its known victims, as from the fact that the unknown must
be far more numerous, and that history gives no account of those
who have been spared in the body in order that they might suffer in
the mind. We hear much of martyrs and confessors--of those who were
slain by the sword, or consumed in the fire: but we know little of
that still larger number who by the mere threat of persecution have
been driven into an outward abandonment of their real opinions; and
who, thus forced into an apostasy the heart abhors, have passed the
remainder of their lives in the practice of a constant and
humiliating hypocrisy. It is this which is the real curse of
religious persecution. For in this way, men being constrained to
mask their thoughts, there arises a habit of securing safety by
falsehood, and of purchasing impunity with deceit. In this way
fraud becomes a necessary of life; insincerity is made a daily
custom; the whole tone of public feeling is vitiated, and the gross
amount of vice and of error fearfully increased. Surely, then, we
have reason to say that, compared to this, all other crimes are of
small account; and we may well be grateful for that increase of
intellectual pursuits which has destroyed an evil that some among
us would even now willingly restore.</p>

<h3>THE MYTHICAL ORIGIN OF HISTORY</h3>
<center>From the 'History of Civilization in England'</center>
<br>
<p>At a very early period in the progress of a people, and long
before they are acquainted with the use of letters, they feel the
want of some resource which in peace may amuse their leisure, and
in war may stimulate their courage. This is supplied to them by the
invention of ballads; which form the groundwork of all historical
knowledge, and which, in one shape or another, are found among some
of the rudest tribes of the earth. They are for the most part sung
by a class of men whose particular business it is thus to preserve
the stock of traditions. Indeed, so natural is this curiosity as to
past events that there are few nations to whom these bards or
minstrels are unknown. Thus, to select a few instances, it is they
who have preserved the popular traditions, not only of Europe, but
also of China, Tibet, and Tartary; likewise of India, of Scinde, of
Beloochistan, of Western Asia, of the islands of the Black Sea, of
Egypt, of Western Africa, of North America, of South America, and
of the islands in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In all these countries, letters were long unknown, and as a
people in that state have no means of perpetuating their history
except by oral tradition, they select the form best calculated to
assist their memory; and it will, I believe, be found that the
first rudiments of knowledge consist always of poetry, and often of
rhyme. The jingle pleases the ear of the barbarian, and affords a
security that he will hand it down to his children in the
unimpaired state in which he received it. This guarantee against
error increases still further the value of these ballads; and
instead of being considered as a mere amusement, they rise to the
dignity of judicial authorities. The allusions contained in them
are satisfactory proofs to decide the merits of rival families, or
even to fix the limits of those rude estates which such a society
can possess. We therefore find that the professed reciters and
composers of these songs are the recognized judges in all disputed
matters; and as they are often priests, and believed to be
inspired, it is probably in this way that the notion of the divine
origin of poetry first arose. These ballads will of course vary
according to the customs and temperaments of the different nations,
and according to the climate to which they are accustomed. In the
south they assume a passionate and voluptuous form; in the north
they are rather remarkable for their tragic and warlike character.
But notwithstanding these diversities, all such productions have
one feature in common: they are not only founded on truth, but
making allowance for the colorings of poetry, they are all strictly
true. Men who are constantly repeating songs which they constantly
hear, and who appeal to the authorized singers of them as final
umpires in disputed questions, are not likely to be mistaken on
matters in the accuracy of which they have so lively an
interest.</p>
<p>This is the earliest and most simple of the various stages
through which history is obliged to pass. But in the course of
time, unless unfavorable circumstances intervene, society advances;
and among other changes, there is one in particular of the greatest
importance. I mean the introduction of the art of writing, which,
before many generations are passed, must effect a complete
alteration in the character of the national traditions. The manner
in which, this occurs has, so far as I am aware, never been pointed
out; and it will therefore be interesting to attempt to trace some
of its details.</p>
<p>The first and perhaps the most obvious consideration is, that
the introduction of the art of writing gives permanence to the
national knowledge, and thus lessens the utility of that oral
information in which all the acquirements of an unlettered people
must be contained. Hence it is that as a country advances the
influence of tradition diminishes, and traditions themselves become
less trustworthy. Besides this, the preservers of these traditions
lose in this stage of society much of their former reputation.
Among a perfectly unlettered people, the singers of ballads are, as
we have already seen, the sole depositaries of those historical
facts on which the fame, and often the property, of their
chieftains principally depend. But when this same nation becomes
acquainted with the art of writing, it grows unwilling to intrust
these matters to the memory of itinerant singers, and avails itself
of its new art to preserve them in a fixed and material form. As
soon as this is effected, the importance of those who repeat the
national traditions is sensibly diminished. They gradually sink
into an inferior class, which, having lost its old reputation, no
longer consists of those superior men to whose abilities it owed
its former fame. Thus we see that although without letters there
can be no knowledge of much importance, it is nevertheless true
that their introduction is injurious to historical traditions in
two distinct ways: first by weakening the traditions, and secondly
by weakening the class of men whose occupation it is to preserve
them.</p>
<p>But this is not all. Not only does the art of writing lessen the
number of traditionary truths, but it directly encourages the
propagation of falsehoods. This is effected by what may be termed a
principle of accumulation, to which all systems of belief have been
deeply indebted. In ancient times, for example, the name of
Hercules was given to several of those great public robbers who
scourged mankind, and who, if their crimes were successful as well
as enormous, were sure after their death to be worshiped as heroes.
How this appellation originated is uncertain; but it was probably
bestowed at first on a single man, and afterwards on those who
resembled him in the character of their achievements. This mode of
extending the use of a single name is natural to a barbarous
people, and would cause little or no confusion, as long as the
tradition of the country remained local and unconnected. But as
soon as these traditions became fixed by a written language, the
collectors of them, deceived by the similarity of name, assembled
the scattered facts, and ascribing to a single man these
accumulated exploits, degraded history to the level of a miraculous
mythology. In the same way, soon after the use of letters was known
in the North of Europe, there was drawn up by Saxo Grammaticus the
life of the celebrated Ragnar Lodbrok. Either from accident or
design, this great warrior of Scandinavia, who had taught England
to tremble, had received the same name as another Ragnar, who was
prince of Jutland about a hundred years earlier. This coincidence
would have caused no confusion as long as each district preserved a
distinct and independent account of its own Ragnar. But by
possessing the resource of writing, men became able to consolidate
the separate trains of events, and as it were, fuse two truths into
one error. And this was what actually happened. The credulous Saxo
put together the different exploits of both Ragnars, and ascribing
the whole of them to his favorite hero, has involved in obscurity
one of the most interesting parts of the early history of
Europe.</p>
<p>The annals of the North afford another curious instance of this
source of error. A tribe of Finns called Qu&aelig;ns occupied a
considerable part of the eastern coast of the Gulf of Bothnia.
Their country was known as Qu&aelig;nland; and this name gave rise
to a belief that to the north of the Baltic there was a nation of
Amazons. This would easily have been corrected by local knowledge:
but by the use of writing, the flying rumor was at once fixed; and
the existence of such a people is positively affirmed in some of
the earliest European histories. Thus too &Aring;bo, the ancient
capital of Finland, was called Turku, which in the Swedish language
means a market-place. Adam of Bremen, having occasion to treat of
the countries adjoining the Baltic, was so misled by the word Turku
that this celebrated historian assures his readers that there were
Turks in Finland.</p>
<p>To these illustrations many others might be added, showing how
mere names deceived the early historians, and gave rise to
relations which were entirely false, and might have been rectified
on the spot; but which, owing to the art of writing, were carried
into distant countries and thus placed beyond the reach of
contradiction. Of such cases, one more may be mentioned, as it
concerns the history of England. Richard I., the most barbarous of
our princes, was known to his contemporaries as the Lion; an
appellation conferred upon him on account of his fearlessness and
the ferocity of his temper. Hence it was said that he had the heart
of a lion; and the title Coeur de Lion not only became indissolubly
connected with his name, but actually gave rise to a story,
repeated by innumerable writers, according to which he slew a lion
in a single combat. The name gave rise to the story; the story
confirmed the name: and another fiction was added to that long
series of falsehoods of which history mainly consisted during the
Middle Ages.</p>
<p>The corruptions of history, thus naturally brought about by the
mere introduction of letters, were in Europe aided by an additional
cause. With the art of writing, there was in most cases also
communicated a knowledge of Christianity; and the new religion not
only destroyed many of the Pagan traditions, but falsified the
remainder by amalgamating them with monastic legends. The extent to
which this was carried would form a curious subject for inquiry;
but one or two instances of it will perhaps be sufficient to
satisfy the generality of readers.</p>
<p>Of the earliest state of the great Northern nations we have
little positive evidence; but several of the lays in which the
Scandinavian poets related the feats of their ancestors or of their
contemporaries are still preserved; and notwithstanding their
subsequent corruption, it is admitted by the most competent judges
that they embody real and historical events. But in the ninth and
tenth centuries, Christian missionaries found their way across the
Baltic, and introduced a knowledge of their religion among the
inhabitants of Northern Europe. Scarcely was this effected when the
sources of history began to be poisoned. At the end of the eleventh
century Saemund Sigfusson, a Christian priest, gathered the popular
and hitherto unwritten histories of the North into what is called
the "Elder Edda"; and he was satisfied with adding to his
compilation the corrective of a Christian hymn. A hundred years
later there was made another collection of the native histories;
but the principle which I have mentioned, having had a longer time
to operate, now displayed its effects still more clearly. In this
second collection, which is known by the name of the 'Younger
Edda,' there is an agreeable mixture of Greek, Jewish, and
Christian fables; and for the first time in the Scandinavian
annals, we meet with the widely diffused fiction of a Trojan
descent.</p>
<p>If by way of further illustration we turn to other parts of the
world, we shall find a series of facts confirming this view. We
shall find that in those countries where there has been no change
of religion, history is more trustworthy and connected than in
those countries where such a change has taken place. In India,
Brahmanism, which is still supreme, was established at so early a
period that its origin is lost in the remotest antiquity. The
consequence is that the native annals have never been corrupted by
any new superstition, and the Hindus are possessed of historic
traditions more ancient than can be found among any other Asiatic
people. In the same way, the Chinese have for upwards of two
thousand years preserved the religion of Fo, which is a form of
Buddhism. In China, therefore, though the civilization has never
been equal to that of India, there is a history, not indeed as old
as the natives would wish us to believe, but still stretching back
to several centuries before the Christian era, from whence it has
been brought down to our own times in an uninterrupted succession.
On the other hand, the Persians, whose intellectual development was
certainly superior to that of the Chinese, are nevertheless without
any authentic information respecting the early transactions of
their ancient monarchy. For this I can see no possible reason
except the fact that Persia, soon after the promulgation of the
Koran, was conquered by the Mohammedans, who completely subverted
the Parsee religion and thus interrupted the stream of the national
traditions. Hence it is that, putting aside the myths of the
Zendavesta, we have no native authorities for Persian history of
any value, until the appearance in the eleventh century of the Shah
Nameh; in which, however, Firdusi has mingled the miraculous
relations of those two religions by which his country had been
successively subjected. The result is, that if it were not for the
various discoveries which have been made, of monuments,
inscriptions, and coins, we should be compelled to rely on the
scanty and inaccurate details in the Greek writers for our
knowledge of the history of one of the most important of the
Asiatic monarchies.</p>

<h2>GEORGE LOUIS LE CLERC BUFFON</h2>
<h3>(1707-1788)</h3>
<center>BY SPENCER TROTTER</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>science becomes part of the general stock of knowledge only
after it has entered into the literature of a people. The bare
skeleton of facts must be clothed with the flesh and blood of
imagination, through the humanizing influence of literary
expression, before it can be assimilated by the average
intellectual being. The scientific investigator is rarely endowed
with the gift of weaving the facts into a story that will charm,
and the man of letters is too often devoid of that patience which
is the chief virtue of the scientist. These gifts of the gods are
bestowed upon mankind under the guiding genius of the division of
labor. The name of Buffon will always be associated with natural
history, though in the man himself the spirit of science was
conspicuously absent. In this respect he was in marked contrast
with his contemporary Linn&aelig;us, whose intellect and labor laid
the foundations of much of the scientific knowledge of to-day.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/buffon.jpg" width="45%" alt=""><br>
<b>Buffon</b></p>
<p>George Louis le Clerc Buffon was born on the 7th of September,
1707, at Montbar, in Burgundy. His father, Benjamin le Clerc, who
was possessed of a fortune, appears to have bestowed great care and
liberality on the education of his son. While a youth Buffon made
the acquaintance of a young English nobleman, the Duke of Kingston,
whose tutor, a man well versed in the knowledge of physical
science, exerted a profound influence on the future career of the
young Frenchman. At twenty-one Buffon came into his mother's
estate, a fortune yielding an annual income of &pound;12,000. But
this wealth did not change his purpose to gain knowledge. He
traveled through Italy, and after living for a short period in
England returned to France and devoted his time to literary work.
His first efforts were translations of two English works of
science--Hale's 'Vegetable Statics' and Newton's 'Fluxions'; and he
followed these with various studies in the different branches of
physical science.</p>
<p>The determining event in his life, which led him to devote the
rest of his years to the study of natural history, was the death of
his friend Du Fay, the Intendant of the Jardin du Roi (now the
Jardin des Plantes), who on his death-bed recommended Buffon as his
successor. A man of letters, Buffon saw before him the opportunity
to write a natural history of the earth and its inhabitants; and he
set to work with a zeal that lasted until his death in 1788, at the
age of eighty-one. His great work, 'L'Histoire Naturelle,' was the
outcome of these years of labor, the first edition being complete
in thirty-six quarto volumes.</p>
<p>The first fifteen volumes of this great work, published between
the years 1749 and 1767, treated of the theory of the earth, the
nature of animals, and the history of man and viviparous
quadrupeds; and was the joint work of Buffon and Daubenton, a
physician of Buffon's native village. The scientific portion of the
work was done by Daubenton, who possessed considerable anatomical
knowledge, and who wrote accurate descriptions of the various
animals mentioned. Buffon, however, affected to ignore the work of
his co-laborer and reaped the entire glory, so that Daubenton
withdrew his services. Later appeared the nine volumes on birds, in
which Buffon was aided by the Abb&eacute; Sexon. Then followed the
'History of Minerals' in five volumes, and seven volumes of
'Supplements,' the last one of which was published the year after
Buffon's death.</p>
<p>One can hardly admire the personal character of Buffon. He was
vain and superficial, and given to extravagant speculations. He is
reported to have said, "I know but five great geniuses--Newton,
Bacon, Leibnitz, Montesquieu, and myself." His natural vanity was
undoubtedly fostered by the adulation which he received from those
in authority. He saw his own statue placed in the cabinet of Louis
XVI., with the inscription "Majestati Natur&aelig; par ingenium."
Louis XV. bestowed upon him a title of nobility, and crowned heads
"addressed him in language of the most exaggerated compliment."
Buffon's conduct and conversation were marked throughout by a
certain coarseness and vulgarity that constantly appear in his
writings. He was foppish and trifling, and affected religion though
at heart a disbeliever.</p>
<p>The chief value of Buffon's work lies in the fact that it first
brought the subject of natural history into popular literature.
Probably no writer of the time, with the exception of Voltaire and
Rousseau, was so widely read and quoted as Buffon. But the gross
inaccuracy which pervaded his writings, and the visionary theories
in which he constantly indulged, gave the work a less permanent
value than it might otherwise have attained. Buffon detested the
scientific method, preferring literary finish to accuracy of
statement. Although the work was widely translated, and was the
only popular natural history of the time, there is little of it
that is worthy of a place in the world's best literature. It is
chiefly as a relic of a past literary epoch, and as the pioneer
work in a new literary field, that Buffon's writings appeal to us.
They awakened for the first time a wide interest in natural
history, though their author was distinctly <i>not</i> a
naturalist.</p>
<p>Arabella Buckley has said of Buffon and his writings that though
"he often made great mistakes and arrived at false conclusions,
still he had so much genius and knowledge that a great part of his
work will always remain true." Cuvier has left us a good memoir of
Buffon in the 'Biographic Universelle.'</p>

<h3>NATURE</h3>
<center>From the 'Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>So with what magnificence Nature shines upon the earth! A pure
light extending from east to west gilds successively the
hemispheres of the globe. An airy transparent element surrounds it;
a warm and fruitful heat animates and develops all its germs of
life; living and salutary waters tend to their support and
increase; high points scattered over the lands, by arresting the
airy vapors, render these sources inexhaustible and always fresh;
gathered into immense hollows, they divide the continents. The
extent of the sea is as great as that of the land. It is not a cold
and sterile element, but another empire as rich and populated as
the first. The finger of God has marked the boundaries. When the
waters encroach upon the beaches of the west, they leave bare those
of the east. This enormous mass of water, itself inert, follows the
guidance of heavenly movements. Balanced by the regular
oscillations of ebb and flow, it rises and falls with the planet of
night; rising still higher when concurrent with the planet of day,
the two uniting their forces during the equinoxes cause the great
tides. Our connection with the heavens is nowhere more clearly
indicated. From these constant and general movements result others
variable and particular: removals of earth, deposits at the bottom
of water forming elevations like those upon the earth's surface,
currents which, following the direction of these mountain ranges,
shape them to corresponding angles; and rolling in the midst of the
waves, as waters upon the earth, are in truth the rivers of the
sea.</p>
<p>The air, too, lighter and more fluid than water, obeys many
forces: the distant action of sun and moon, the immediate action of
the sea, that of rarefying heat and of condensing cold, produce in
it continual agitations. The winds are its currents, driving before
them and collecting the clouds. They produce meteors; transport the
humid vapors of maritime beaches to the land surfaces of the
continents; determine the storms; distribute the fruitful rains and
kindly dews; stir the sea; agitate the mobile waters, arrest or
hasten the currents; raise floods; excite tempests. The angry sea
rises toward heaven and breaks roaring against immovable dikes,
which it can neither destroy nor surmount.</p>
<p>The land elevated above sea-level is safe from these irruptions.
Its surface, enameled with flowers, adorned with ever fresh
verdure, peopled with thousands and thousands of differing species
of animals, is a place of repose; an abode of delights, where man,
placed to aid nature, dominates all other things, the only one who
can know and admire. God has made him spectator of the universe and
witness of his marvels. He is animated by a divine spark which
renders him a participant in the divine mysteries; and by whose
light he thinks and reflects, sees and reads in the book of the
world as in a copy of divinity.</p>
<p>Nature is the exterior throne of God's glory. The man who
studies and contemplates it rises gradually towards the interior
throne of omniscience. Made to adore the Creator, he commands all
the creatures. Vassal of heaven, king of earth, which he ennobles
and enriches, he establishes order, harmony, and subordination
among living beings. He embellishes Nature itself; cultivates,
extends, and refines it; suppresses its thistles and brambles, and
multiplies its grapes and roses.</p>
<p>Look upon the solitary beaches and sad lands where man has never
dwelt: covered--or rather bristling--with thick black woods on all
their rising ground, stunted barkless trees, bent, twisted, falling
from age; near by, others even more numerous, rotting upon heaps
already rotten,--stifling, burying the germs ready to burst forth.
Nature, young everywhere else, is here decrepit. The land
surmounted by the ruins of these productions offers, instead of
flourishing verdure, only an incumbered space pierced by aged
trees, loaded with parasitic plants, lichens, agarics--impure
fruits of corruption. In the low parts is water, dead and stagnant
because undirected; or swampy soil neither solid nor liquid, hence
unapproachable and useless to the habitants both of land and of
water. Here are swamps covered with rank aquatic plants nourishing
only venomous insects and haunted by unclean animals. Between these
low infectious marshes and these higher ancient forests extend
plains having nothing in common with our meadows, upon which weeds
smother useful plants. There is none of that fine turf which seems
like down upon the earth, or of that enameled lawn which announces
a brilliant fertility; but instead an interlacement of hard and
thorny herbs which seem to cling to each other rather than to the
soil, and which, successively withering and impeding each other,
form a coarse mat several feet thick. There are no roads, no
communications, no vestiges of intelligence in these wild places.
Man, obliged to follow the paths of savage beasts and to watch
constantly lest he become their prey, terrified by their roars,
thrilled by the very silence of these profound solitudes, turns
back and says:--</p>
<p>Primitive nature is hideous and dying; I, I alone, can make it
living and agreeable. Let us dry these swamps; converting into
streams and canals, animate these dead waters by setting them in
motion. Let us use the active and devouring element once hidden
from us, and which we ourselves have discovered; and set fire to
this superfluous mat, to these aged forests already half consumed,
and finish with iron what fire cannot destroy! Soon, instead of
rush and water-lily from which the toad compounds his venom, we
shall see buttercups and clover, sweet and salutary herbs. Herds of
bounding animals will tread this once impracticable soil and find
abundant, constantly renewed pasture. They will multiply, to
multiply again. Let us employ the new aid to complete our work; and
let the ox, submissive to the yoke, exercise his strength in
furrowing the land. Then it will grow young again with cultivation,
and a new nature shall spring up under our hands.</p>
<p>How beautiful is cultivated Nature when by the cares of man she
is brilliantly and pompously adorned! He himself is the chief
ornament, the most noble production; in multiplying himself he
multiplies her most precious gem. She seems to multiply herself
with him, for his art brings to light all that her bosom conceals.
What treasures hitherto ignored! What new riches! Flowers, fruits,
perfected grains infinitely multiplied; useful species of animals
transported, propagated, endlessly increased; harmful species
destroyed, confined, banished; gold, and iron more necessary than
gold, drawn from the bowels of the earth; torrents confined; rivers
directed and restrained; the sea, submissive and comprehended,
crossed from one hemisphere to the other; the earth everywhere
accessible, everywhere living and fertile; in the valleys, laughing
prairies; in the plains, rich pastures or richer harvests; the
hills loaded with vines and fruits, their summits crowned by useful
trees and young forests; deserts changed to cities inhabited by a
great people, who, ceaselessly circulating, scatter themselves from
centres to extremities; frequent open roads and communications
established everywhere like so many witnesses of the force and
union of society; a thousand other monuments of power and glory:
proving that man, master of the world, has transformed it, renewed
its whole surface, and that he shares his empire with Nature.</p>
<p>However, he rules only by right of conquest, and enjoys rather
than possesses. He can only retain by ever-renewed efforts. If
these cease, everything languishes, changes, grows disordered,
enters again into the hands of Nature. She retakes her rights;
effaces man's work; covers his most sumptuous monuments with dust
and moss; destroys them in time, leaving him only the regret that
he has lost by his own fault the conquests of his ancestors. These
periods during which man loses his domain, ages of barbarism when
everything perishes, are always prepared by wars and arrive with
famine and depopulation. Man, who can do nothing except in numbers,
and is only strong in union, only happy in peace, has the madness
to arm himself for his unhappiness and to fight for his own ruin.
Incited by insatiable greed, blinded by still more insatiable
ambition, he renounces the sentiments of humanity, turns all his
forces against himself, and seeking to destroy his fellow, does
indeed destroy himself. And after these days of blood and carnage,
when the smoke of glory has passed away, he sees with sadness that
the earth is devastated, the arts buried, the nations dispersed,
the races enfeebled, his own happiness ruined, and his power
annihilated.</p>

<h3>THE HUMMING-BIRD</h3>
<center>From the 'Natural History'</center>
<br>
<p>Of all animated beings this is the most elegant in form and the
most brilliant in colors. The stones and metals polished by our
arts are not comparable to this jewel of Nature. She has placed it
least in size of the order of birds, <i>maxime miranda in
minimis</i>. Her masterpiece is the little humming-bird, and upon
it she has heaped all the gifts which the other birds may only
share. Lightness, rapidity, nimbleness, grace, and rich apparel all
belong to this little favorite. The emerald, the ruby, and the
topaz gleam upon its dress. It never soils them with the dust of
earth, and in its a&euml;rial life scarcely touches the turf an
instant. Always in the air, flying from flower to flower, it has
their freshness as well as their brightness. It lives upon their
nectar, and dwells only in the climates where they perennially
bloom.</p>
<p>All kinds of humming-birds are found in the hottest countries of
the New World. They are quite numerous and seem to be confined
between the two tropics, for those which penetrate the temperate
zones in summer only stay there a short time. They seem to follow
the sun in its advance and retreat; and to fly on the wing of
zephyrs after an eternal spring.</p>
<p>The smaller species of the humming-birds are less in size than
the great fly wasp, and more slender than the drone. Their beak is
a fine needle and their tongue a slender thread. Their little black
eyes are like two shining points, and the feathers of their wings
so delicate that they seem transparent. Their short feet, which
they use very little, are so tiny one can scarcely see them. They
alight only at night, resting in the air during the day. They have
a swift continual humming flight. The movement of their wings is so
rapid that when pausing in the air, the bird seems quite
motionless. One sees him stop before a blossom, then dart like a
flash to another, visiting all, plunging his tongue into their
hearts, flattening them with his wings, never settling anywhere,
but neglecting none. He hastens his inconstancies only to pursue
his loves more eagerly and to multiply his innocent joys. For this
light lover of flowers lives at their expense without ever
blighting them. He only pumps their honey, and to this alone his
tongue seems destined.</p>
<p>The vivacity of these small birds is only equaled by their
courage, or rather their audacity. Sometimes they may be seen
chasing furiously birds twenty times their size, fastening upon
their bodies, letting themselves be carried along in their flight,
while they peck them fiercely until their tiny rage is satisfied.
Sometimes they fight each other vigorously. Impatience seems their
very essence. If they approach a blossom and find it faded, they
mark their spite by hasty rending of the petals. Their only voice
is a weak cry, "<i>screp, screp</i>," frequent and repeated, which
they utter in the woods from dawn, until at the first rays of the
sun they all take flight and scatter over the country.</p>

<h2>EDWARD BULWER-LYTTON</h2>
<h3>(1803-1873)</h3>
<center>BY JULIAN HAWTHORNE</center>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.jpg" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he patrician in literature is always an interesting spectacle.
We are prone to regard his performance as a test of the worth of
long descent and high breeding. If he does well, he vindicates the
claims of his caste; if ill, we infer that inherited estates and
blue blood are but surface advantages, leaving the effective brain
unimproved, or even causing deterioration. But the argument is
still open; and whether genius be the creature of circumstance or
divinely independent, is a question which prejudice rather than
evidence commonly decides.</p>
<p>Certainly literature tries men's souls. The charlatan must
betray himself. Genius shines through all cerements. On the other
hand, genius may be nourished, and the charlatan permeates all
classes. The truth probably is that an aristocrat is quite as apt
as a plebeian to be a good writer. Only since there are fewer of
the former than of the latter, and since, unlike the last, the
first are seldom forced to live by their brains, there are more
plebeian than aristocratic names on the literary roll of honor.
Admitting this, the instance of the writer known as "Bulwer" proves
nothing one way or the other. At all events, not, Was he a genius
because he was a, patrician? but, Was he a genius at all? is the
inquiry most germane to our present purpose.</p>
<p>An aristocrat of aristocrats undoubtedly he was, though it
concerns us not to determine whether the blood of Plantagenet kings
and Norman conquerors really flowed in his veins. On both father's
and mother's side he was thoroughly well connected. Heydon Hall in
Norfolk was the hereditary home of the Norman Bulwers; the Saxon
Lyttons had since the Conquest lived at Knebworth in Derbyshire.
The historic background of each family was honorable, and when the
marriage of William Earle Bulwer with Elizabeth Barbara Lytton
united them, it might be said that in their offspring England found
her type.</p>
<p>Edward, being the youngest son, had little money, but he
happened to have brains. He began existence delicate and
precocious. Culture, with him, set in almost with what he would
have termed the "consciousness of his own identity," and the
process never intermitted: in fact, appearances to the contrary
notwithstanding, his spiritual and intellectual emancipation was
hindered by many obstacles; for, an ailing child, he was petted by
his mother, and such germs of intelligence (verses at seven years
old, and the like) as he betrayed were trumpeted as prodigies. He
was spoilt so long before he was ripe that it is a marvel he ever
ripened at all. Many years must pass before vanity could be
replaced in him by manly ambition; a vein of silliness is traceable
through his career almost to the end. He expatiated in the falsetto
key; almost never do we hear in his voice that hearty bass note so
dear to plain humanity. In his pilgrimage toward freedom he had to
wrestle not only with flesh-and-blood mothers, uncles, and wives,
<i>et id genus omne</i>, but with the more subtle and vital ideas,
superstitions, and prejudices appertaining to his social station.
His worst foes were not those of his household merely, but of his
heart. The more arduous achievement of such a man is to see his
real self and believe in it. There are so many misleading
purple-velvet waistcoats, gold chains, superfine sentiments, and
blue-blooded affiliations in the way, that the true nucleus of so
much decoration becomes less accessible than the needle in the
hay-stack. It is greatly to Bulwer's credit that he stuck valiantly
to his quest, and nearly, if not quite, ran down his game at last.
His intellectual record is one of constant progress, from childhood
to age.</p>
<p>Whether his advance in other respects was as uniform does not
much concern us. He was unhappy with his wife, and perhaps they
even threw things at each other at table, the servants looking on.
Nothing in his matrimonial relations so much became him as his
conduct after their severance: he held his tongue like a man, in
spite of the poor lady's shrieks and clapper-clawings. His
whimsical, hair-splitting conscientiousness is less admirable. A
healthy conscience does not whine--it creates. No one cares to know
what a man thinks of his own actions. No one is interested to learn
that Bulwer meant 'Paul Clifford' to be an edifying work, or that
he married his wife from the highest motives. We do not take him so
seriously: we are satisfied that he wrote the story first and
discovered its morality afterwards; and that lofty motives would
not have united him to Miss Rosina Doyle Wheeler had she not been
pretty and clever. His hectic letters to his mamma; his Byronic
struttings and mouthings over the grave of his schoolgirl
lady-love; his eighteenth-century comedy-scene with Caroline Lamb;
his starched-frill participation in the Fred Villiers duel at
Boulogne,--how silly and artificial is all this! There is no
genuine feeling in it: he attires himself in tawdry sentiment as in
a flowered waistcoat. What a difference between him, at this
period, and his contemporary Benjamin Disraeli, who indeed
committed similar inanities, but with a saturnine sense of humor
cropping out at every turn which altered the whole complexion of
the performance. We laugh at the one, but with the other.</p>

<br>
<p>Of course, however, there was a man hidden somewhere in Edward
Bulwer's perfumed clothes and mincing attitudes, else the world had
long since forgotten him. Amidst his dandyism, he learned how to
speak well in debate and how to use his hands to guard his head; he
paid his debts by honest hard work, and would not be dishonorably
beholden to his mother or any one else. He posed as a blighted
being, and invented black evening-dress; but he lived down the
scorn of such men as Tennyson and Thackeray, and won their respect
and friendship at last. He aimed high, according to his lights,
meant well, and in the long run did well too.</p>
<p>The main activities of his life--and from start to finish his
energy was great--were in politics and in literature. His political
career covers about forty years, from the time he took his degree
at Cambridge till Lord Derby made him a peer in 1866. He
accomplished nothing of serious importance, but his course was
always creditable: he began as a sentimental Radical and ended as a
liberal Conservative; he advocated the Crimean War; the Corn Laws
found him in a compromising humor; his record as Colonial Secretary
offers nothing memorable in statesmanship. The extraordinary
brilliancy of his brother Henry's diplomatic life throws Edward's
achievements into the shade. There is nothing to be ashamed of, but
had he done nothing else he would have been unknown. But
literature, first seriously cultivated as a means of livelihood,
outlasted his political ambitions, and his books are to-day his
only claim to remembrance. They made a strong impression at the
time they were written, and many are still read as much as ever, by
a generation born after his death. Their popularity is not of the
catchpenny sort; thoughtful people read them, as well as the great
drove of the undiscriminating. For they are the product of thought:
they show workmanship; they have quality; they are carefully made.
If the literary critic never finds occasion to put off the shoes
from his feet as in the sacred presence of genius, he is constantly
moved to recognize with a friendly nod the presence of sterling
talent. He is even inclined to think that nobody else ever had so
much talent as this little red-haired, blue-eyed, high-nosed,
dandified Edward Bulwer; the mere mass of it lifts him at times to
the levels where genius dwells, though he never quite shares their
nectar and ambrosia. He as it were catches echoes of the talk of
the Immortals,--the turn of their phrase, the intonation of their
utterance,--and straightway reproduces it with the fidelity of the
phonograph. But, as in the phonograph, we find something lacking;
our mind accepts the report as genuine, but our ear affirms an
unreality; this is reproduction, indeed, but not creation. Bulwer
himself, when his fit is past, and his critical faculty re-awakens,
probably knows as well as another that these labored and
meritorious pages of his are not graven on the eternal adamant. But
they are the best he can do, and perhaps there is none better of
their kind. They have a right to be; for while genius may do harm
as well as good, Bulwer never does harm, and in spite of sickly
sentiment and sham philosophy, is uniformly instructive, amusing,
and edifying.</p>
<p>"To love her," wrote Dick Steele of a certain great dame, "is a
liberal education;" and we might almost say the same of the reading
of Bulwer's romances. He was learned, and he put into his books all
his learning, as well as all else that was his. They represent
artistically grouped, ingeniously lighted, with suitable
acompaniments of music and illusion--the acquisitions of his
intellect, the sympathies of his nature, and the achievements of
his character.</p>
<p>He wrote in various styles, making deliberate experiments in one
after another, and often hiding himself completely in anonymity. He
was versatile, not deep. Robert Louis Stevenson also employs
various styles; but with him the changes are intuitive--they are
the subtle variations in touch and timbre which genius makes, in
harmony with the subject treated. Stevenson could not have written
'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' in the same tune and key as 'Treasure
Island'; and the music of 'Marxheim' differs from both. The reason
is organic: the writer is inspired by his theme, and it passes
through his mind with a lilt and measure of its own. It makes its
own style, just as a human spirit makes its own features and gait;
and we know Stevenson through all his transformations only by dint
of the exquisite distinction and felicity of word and phrase that
always characterize him. Now, with Bulwer there is none of this
lovely inevitable spontaneity. He costumes his tale arbitrarily,
like a stage-haberdasher, and invents a voice to deliver it withal.
'The Last Days of Pompeii' shall be mouthed out grandiloquently;
the incredibilities of 'The Coming Race' shall wear the guise of
na&iuml;ve and artless narrative; the humors of 'The Caxtons' and
'What Will He Do with It?' shall reflect the mood of the sagacious,
affable man of the world, gossiping over the nuts and wine; the
marvels of 'Zanoni' and 'A Strange Story' must be portrayed with a
resonance and exaltation of diction fitted to their transcendental
claims. But between the stark mechanism of the Englishman and the
lithe, inspired felicity of the Scot, what a difference!</p>
<p>Bulwer's work may be classified according to subject, though not
chronologically. He wrote novels of society, of history, of
mystery, and of romance. In all he was successful, and perhaps felt
as much interest in one as in another. In his own life the study of
the occult played a part; he was familiar with the contemporary
fads in mystery and acquainted with their professors. "Ancient"
history also attracted him, and he even wrote a couple of volumes
of a 'History of Athens.' In all his writing there is a tendency to
lapse into a discussion of the "Ideal and the Real," aiming always
at the conclusion that the only true Real is the Ideal. It was this
tendency which chiefly aroused the ridicule of his critics, and
from the 'Sredwardlyttonbulwig' of Thackeray to the 'Condensed
Novels' burlesque of Bret Harte, they harp upon that facile string,
The thing satirized is after all not cheaper than the satire. The
ideal <i>is</i> the true real; the only absurdity lies in the pomp
and circumstance wherewith that simple truth is introduced. There
<i>is</i> a 'Dweller on the Threshold,' but it, or he, is nothing
more than that doubt concerning the truth of spiritual things which
assails all beginners in higher speculation, and there was no need
to call it or him by so formidable a name. A sense of humor would
have saved Bulwer from almost all his faults, and have endowed him
with several valuable virtues into the bargain; but it was not born
in him, and with all his diligence he never could beget it.</p>
<p>The domestic series, of which 'The Caxtons' is the type, are the
most generally popular of his works, and are likely to be so
longest. The romantic vein ('Ernest Maltravers,' 'Alice, or the
Mysteries,' etc.) are in his worst style, and are now only in
existence as books because they are members of "the edition," It is
doubtful if any human being has read one of them through in twenty
years. Such historical books as 'The Last Days of Pompeii' are not
only well constructed dramatically, but are painfully accurate in
details, and may still be read for information as well as for
pleasure. The 'Zanoni' species is undeniably interesting. The weird
traditions of the 'Philosopher's Stone' and the 'Elixir of Life'
can never cease to fascinate human souls, and all the paraphernalia
of magic are charming to minds weary of the matter-of-factitude of
current existence. The stories are put together with Bulwer's
unfailing cleverness, and in all external respects neither Dumas
nor Balzac has done anything better in this kind: the trouble is
that these authors compel our belief, while Bulwer does not. For,
once more, he lacks the magic of genius and the spirit of style
which are immortally and incommunicably theirs, without which no
other magic can be made literarily effective.</p>
<p>'Pelham,' written at twenty-five years of age, is a creditable
boy's book; it aims to portray character as well as to develop
incidents, and in spite of the dreadful silliness of its
melodramatic passages it has merit. Conventionally it is more
nearly a work of art than that other famous boy's book, Disraeli's
'Vivian Grey,' though the latter is alive and blooming with the
original literary charm which is denied to the other. Other
characteristic novels of his are 'The Last Days of Pompeii,'
'Ernest Maltravers,' 'Zanoni,' 'The Caxtons,' 'My Novel,' 'What
Will He Do with It?' 'A Strange Story,' 'The Coming Race,' and
'Kenelm Chillingly,' the last of which appeared in the year of the
author's death, 1873. The student who has read these books will
know all that is worth knowing of Bulwer's work. He wrote upwards
of fifty substantial volumes, and left a mass of posthumous
material besides. Of all that he did, the most nearly satisfactory
thing is one of the last, 'Kenelm Chillingly.' In style, persons,
and incidents it is alike charming: it subsides somewhat into the
inevitable Bulwer sentimentality towards the end--a silk purse
cannot be made out of a sow's ear; but the miracle was never nearer
being accomplished than in this instance. Here we see the
thoroughly equipped man of letters doing with apparent ease what
scarce five of his contemporaries could have done at all. The book
is lightsome and graceful, yet it touches serious thoughts: most
remarkable of all, it shows a suppleness of mind and freshness of
feeling more to be expected in a youth of thirty than in a veteran
of threescore and ten. Bulwer never ceased to grow; and what is
better still, to grow away from his faults and towards
improvement.</p>
<p>But in comparing him with others, we must admit that he had
better opportunities than most. His social station brought him in
contact with the best people and most pregnant events of his time;
and the driving poverty of youth having established him in the
novel-writing habit, he thereafter had leisure to polish and expand
his faculty to the utmost. No talent of his was folded up in a
napkin: he did his best and utmost with all he had. Whereas the
path of genius is commonly tortuous and hard-beset: and while we
are always saying of Shakespeare, or Thackeray, or Shelley, or
Keats, or Poe, "What wonders they would have done had life been
longer or fate kinder to them!"--of Bulwer we say, "No help was
wanting to him, and he profited by all; he got out of the egg more
than we had believed was in it!" Instead of a great faculty hobbled
by circumstance, we have a small faculty magnified by occasion and
enriched by time.</p>
<p>Certainly, as men of letters go, Bulwer must be accounted
fortunate. The long inflamed row of his domestic life apart, all
things went his way. He received large sums for his books; at the
age of forty, his mother dying, he succeeded to the Knebworth
estate; three-and-twenty years later his old age (if such a man
could be called old) was consoled by the title of Lord Lytton. His
health was never robust, and occasionally failed; but he seems to
have been able to accomplish after a fashion everything that he
undertook; he was "thorough," as the English say. He lived in the
midst of events; he was a friend of the men who made the age, and
saw them make it, lending a hand himself too when and where he
could. He lived long enough to see the hostility which had opposed
him in youth die away, and honor and kindness take its place. Let
it be repeated, his aims were good. He would have been candid and
un-selfconscious had that been possible for him; and perhaps the
failure was one of manner rather than of heart.--Yes, he was a
fortunate man.</p>
<p>His most conspicuous success was as a play-writer. In view of
his essentially dramatic and historic temperament, it is surprising
that he did not altogether devote himself to this branch of art;
but all his dramas were produced between his thirty-third and his
thirty-eighth years. The first--'La Duchesse de la Valliere' was
not to the public liking; but 'The Lady of Lyons,' written in two
weeks, is in undiminished favor after near sixty years; and so are
'Richelieu' and 'Money.' There is no apparent reason why Bulwer
should not have been as prolific a stage-author as Moli&egrave;re
or even Lope de Vega. But we often value our best faculties
least.</p>
<p>'The Coming Race,' published anonymously and never acknowledged
during his life, was an unexpected product of his mind, but is
useful to mark his limitations. It is a forecast of the future, and
proves, as nothing else could so well do, the utter absence in
Bulwer of the creative imagination. It is an invention, cleverly
conceived, mechanically and rather tediously worked out, and
written in a style astonishingly commonplace. The man who wrote
that book (one would say) had no heaven in his soul, nor any
pinions whereon to soar heavenward. Yet it is full of thought and
ingenuity, and the central conception of "vrii" has been much
commended. But the whole concoction is tainted with the deadness of
stark materialism, and we should be unjust, after all, to deny
Bulwer something loftier and broader than is discoverable here. In
inventing the narrative he depended upon the weakest element in his
mental make-up, and the result could not but be dismal. We like to
believe that there was better stuff in him than he himself ever
found; and that when he left this world for the next, he had
sloughed off more dross than most men have time to accumulate.</p>

<h3>THE AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
<center>From 'The Last Days of Pompeii'</center>
<br>
<p>On the upper tier (but apart from the male spectators) sat the
women, their gay dresses resembling some gaudy flowerbed; it is
needless to add that they were the most talkative part of the
assembly; and many were the looks directed up to them, especially
from the benches appropriated to the young and the unmarried men.
On the lower seats round the arena sat the more high-born and
wealthy visitors--the magistrates and those of senatorial or
equestrian dignity: the passages which, by corridors at the right
and left, gave access to these seats, at either end of the oval
arena, were also the entrances for the combatants. Strong palings
at these passages prevented any unwelcome eccentricity in the
movements of the beasts, and confined them to their appointed prey.
Around the parapet which was raised above the arena, and from which
the seats gradually rose, were gladiatorial inscriptions, and
paintings wrought in fresco, typical of the entertainments for
which the place was designed. Throughout the whole building wound
invisible pipes, from which, as the day advanced, cooling and
fragrant showers were to be sprinkled over the spectators. The
officers of the amphitheatre were still employed in the task of
fixing the vast awning (or <i>velaria</i>) which covered the whole,
and which luxurious invention the Campanians arrogated to
themselves: it was woven of the whitest Apulian wool, and
variegated with broad stripes of crimson. Owing either to some
inexperience on the part of the workmen or to some defect in the
machinery, the awning, however, was not arranged that day so
happily as usual; indeed, from the immense space of the
circumference, the task was always one of great difficulty and
art--so much so that it could seldom be adventured in rough or
windy weather. But the present day was so remarkably still that
there seemed to the spectators no excuse for the awkwardness of the
artificers; and when a large gap in the back of the awning was
still visible, from the obstinate refusal of one part of the
velaria to ally itself with the rest, the murmurs of discontent
were loud and general.</p>
<p>The sedile Pansa, at whose expense the exhibition was given,
looked particularly annoyed at the defect, and vowed bitter
vengeance on the head of the chief officer of the show, who,
fretting, puffing, perspiring, busied himself in idle orders and
unavailing threats.</p>
<p>The hubbub ceased suddenly--the operators desisted--the crowd
were stilled--the gap was forgotten--for now, with a loud and
warlike flourish of trumpets, the gladiators, marshaled in
ceremonious procession, entered the arena. They swept round the
oval space very slowly and deliberately, in order to give the
spectators full leisure to admire their stern serenity of
feature--their brawny limbs and various arms, as well as to form
such wagers as the excitement of the moment might suggest.</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried the widow Fulvia to the wife of Pansa, as they
leaned down from their lofty bench, "do you see that gigantic
gladiator? how drolly he is dressed!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the aedile's wife with complacent importance, for
she knew all the names and qualities of each combatant: "he is a
retiarius or netter; he is armed only, you see, with a
three-pronged spear like a trident, and a net; he wears no armor,
only the fillet and the tunic. He is a mighty man, and is to fight
with Sporus, yon thick-set gladiator, with the round shield and
drawn sword but without body armor; he has not his helmet on now,
in order that you may see his face--how fearless it is! By-and-by
he will fight with his visor down."</p>
<p>"But surely a net and a spear are poor arms against a shield and
sword?"</p>
<p>"That shows how innocent you are, my dear Fulvia: the retiarius
has generally the best of it."</p>
<p>"But who is yon handsome gladiator, nearly naked--is it not
quite improper? By Venus! but his limbs are beautifully
shaped!"</p>
<p>"It is Lydon, a young untried man! he has the rashness to fight
yon other gladiator similarly dressed, or rather
undressed--Tetraides. They fight first in the Greek fashion, with
the cestus; afterward they put on armor, and try sword and
shield."</p>
<p>"He is a proper man, this Lydon; and the women, I am sure, are
on his side."</p>
<p>"So are not the experienced bettors: Clodius offers three to one
against him."</p>
<p>"Oh, Jove! how beautiful!" exclaimed the widow, as two
gladiators, armed <i>cap-&agrave;-pie,</i> rode round the arena on
light and prancing steeds. Resembling much the combatants in the
tilts of the middle age, they bore lances and round shields
beautifully inlaid; their armor was woven intricately with bands of
iron, but it covered only the thighs and the right arms; short
cloaks extending to the seat gave a picturesque and graceful air to
their costume; their legs were naked with the exception of sandals,
which were fastened a little above the ankle. "Oh, beautiful! Who
are these?" asked the widow.</p>
<p>"The one is named Berbix: he has conquered twelve times. The
other assumes the arrogant Nobilior. They are both Gauls."</p>
<p>While thus conversing, the first formalities of the show were
over. To these succeeded a feigned combat with wooden swords
between the various gladiators matched against each other. Among
these the skill of two Roman gladiators, hired for the occasion,
was the most admired; and next to them the most graceful combatant
was Lydon. This sham contest did not last above an hour, nor did it
attract any very lively interest except among those connoisseurs of
the arena to whom art was preferable to more coarse excitement; the
body of the spectators were rejoiced when it was over, and when the
sympathy rose to terror. The combatants were now arranged in pairs,
as agreed beforehand; their weapons examined; and the grave sports
of the day commenced amid the deepest silence--broken only by an
exciting and preliminary blast of warlike music.</p>
<p>It was often customary to begin the sports by the most cruel of
all; and some bestiarius, or gladiator appointed to the beasts, was
slain first as an initiatory sacrifice. But in the present instance
the experienced Pansa thought better that the sanguinary drama
should advance, not decrease, in interest; and accordingly the
execution of Olinthus and Glaucus was reserved for the last. It was
arranged that the two horsemen should first occupy the arena; that
the foot gladiators, paired off, should then be loosed
indiscriminately on the stage; that Glaucus and the lion should
next perform their part in the bloody spectacle; and the tiger and
the Nazarene be the grand finale. And in the spectacles of Pompeii,
the reader of Roman history must limit his imagination, nor expect
to find those vast and wholesale exhibitions of magnificent
slaughter with which a Nero or a Caligula regaled the inhabitants
of the Imperial City. The Roman shows, which absorbed the more
celebrated gladiators and the chief proportion of foreign beasts,
were indeed the very reason why in the lesser towns of the empire
the sports of the amphitheatre were comparatively humane and rare;
and in this as in other respects, Pompeii was the miniature, the
microcosm of Rome. Still, it was an awful and imposing spectacle,
with which modern times have, happily, nothing to compare; a vast
theatre, rising row upon row, and swarming with human beings, from
fifteen to eighteen thousand in number, intent upon no fictitious
representation--no tragedy of the stage--but the actual victory or
defeat, the exultant life or the bloody death, of each and all who
entered the arena!</p>
<p>The two horsemen were now at either extremity of the lists (if
so they might be called), and at a given signal from Pansa the
combatants started simultaneously as in full collision, each
advancing his round buckler, each poising on high his sturdy
javelin; but just when within three paces of his opponent, the
steed of Berbix suddenly halted, wheeled round, and, as Nobilior
was borne rapidly by, his antagonist spurred upon him. The buckler
of Nobilior, quickly and skillfully extended, received a blow which
otherwise would have been fatal.</p>
<p>"Well done, Nobilior!" cried the pr&aelig;tor, giving the first
vent to the popular excitement.</p>
<p>"Bravely struck, my Berbix!" answered Clodius from his seat.</p>
<p>And the wild murmur, swelled by many a shout, echoed from side
to side.</p>
<p>The visors of both the horsemen were completely closed (like
those of the knights in after times), but the head was nevertheless
the great point of assault; and Nobilior, now wheeling his charger
with no less adroitness than his opponent, directed his spear full
on the helmet of his foe. Berbix raised his buckler to shield
himself, and his quick-eyed antagonist, suddenly lowering his
weapon, pierced him through the breast. Berbix reeled and fell.</p>
<p>"Nobilior! Nobilior!" shouted the populace.</p>
<p>"I have lost ten sestertia," said Clodius, between his
teeth.</p>
<p>"<i>Habet</i>!" (He has it) said Pansa deliberately.</p>
<p>The populace, not yet hardened into cruelty, made the signal of
mercy: but as the attendants of the arena approached, they found
the kindness came too late; the heart of the Gaul had been pierced,
and his eyes were set in death. It was his life's blood that flowed
so darkly over the sand and sawdust of the arena.</p>
<p>"It is a pity it was so soon over--there was little enough for
one's trouble," said the widow Fulvia.</p>
<p>"Yes--I have no compassion for Berbix. Any one might have seen
that Nobilior did but feint. Mark, they fix the fatal hook to the
body--they drag him away to the spoliarium--they scatter new sand
over the stage! Pansa regrets nothing more than that he is not rich
enough to strew the arena with borax and cinnabar, as Nero used to
do."</p>
<p>"Well, if it has been a brief battle, it is quickly succeeded.
See my handsome Lydon on the arena--ay, and the net-bearer too, and
the swordsmen! Oh, charming!"</p>
<p>There were now on the arena six combatants: Niger and his net,
matched against Sporus with his shield and his short broad-sword;
Lydon and Tetraides, naked save by a cincture round the waist, each
armed only with a heavy Greek cestus; and two gladiators from Rome,
clad in complete steel, and evenly matched with immense bucklers
and pointed swords.</p>
<p>The initiatory contest between Lydon and Tetraides being less
deadly than that between the other combatants, no sooner had they
advanced to the middle of the arena than as by common consent the
rest held back, to see how that contest should be decided, and wait
till fiercer weapons might replace the cestus ere they themselves
commenced hostilities. They stood leaning on their arms and apart
from each other, gazing on the show, which, if not bloody enough
thoroughly to please the populace, they were still inclined to
admire because its origin was of their ancestral Greece.</p>
<p>No persons could at first glance have seemed less evenly matched
than the two antagonists. Tetraides, though no taller than Lydon,
weighed considerably more; the natural size of his muscles was
increased, to the eyes of the vulgar, by masses of solid flesh;
for, as it was a notion that the contest of the cestus fared
easiest with him who was plumpest, Tetraides had encouraged to the
utmost his hereditary predisposition to the portly. His shoulders
were vast, and his lower limbs thick-set, double-jointed, and
slightly curved outward, in that formation which takes so much from
beauty to give so largely to strength. But Lydon, except that he
was slender even almost to meagreness, was beautifully and
delicately proportioned; and the skillful might have perceived that
with much less compass of muscle than his foe, that which he had
was more seasoned--iron and compact. In proportion, too, as he
wanted flesh, he was likely to possess activity; and a haughty
smile on his resolute face, which strongly contrasted with the
solid heaviness of his enemy's, gave assurance to those who beheld
it and united their hope to their pity; so that despite the
disparity of their seeming strength, the cry of the multitude was
nearly as loud for Lydon as for Tetraides.</p>
<p>Whoever is acquainted with the modern prize-ring--whoever has
witnessed the heavy and disabling strokes which the human fist,
skillfully directed, hath the power to bestow--may easily
understand how much that happy facility would be increased by a
band carried by thongs of leather round the arm as high as the
elbow, and terribly strengthened about the knuckles by a plate of
iron, and sometimes a plummet of lead. Yet this, which was meant to
increase, perhaps rather diminished, the interest of the fray; for
it necessarily shortened its duration. A very few blows,
successfully and scientifically planted, might suffice to bring the
contest to a close; and the battle did not, therefore, often allow
full scope for the energy, fortitude, and dogged perseverance that
we technically style <i>pluck</i>, which not unusually wins the day
against superior science, and which heightens to so painful a
delight the interest in the battle and the sympathy for the
brave.</p>
<p>"Guard thyself!" growled Tetraides, moving nearer and nearer to
his foe, who rather shifted round him than receded.</p>
<p>Lydon did not answer, save by a scornful glance of his quick,
vigilant eye. Tetraides struck--it was as the blow of a smith on a
vise; Lydon sank suddenly on one knee--the blow passed over his
head. Not so harmless was Lydon's retaliation; he quickly sprang to
his feet, and aimed his cestus full on the broad chest of his
antagonist. Tetraides reeled--the populace shouted.</p>
<p>"You are unlucky to-day," said Lepidus to Clodius: "you have
lost one bet; you will lose another."</p>
<p>"By the gods! my bronzes go to the auctioneer if that is the
case. I have no less than a hundred sestertia upon Tetraides. Ha,
ha! see how he rallies! That was a home stroke: he has cut open
Lydon's shoulder.--A Tetraides!--a Tetraides!"</p>
<p>"But Lydon is not disheartened. By Pollux! how well he keeps his
temper! See how dextrously he avoids those hammer-like
hands!--dodging now here, now there--circling round and round. Ah,
poor Lydon! he has it again."</p>
<p>"Three to one still on Tetraides! What say you, Lepidus?"</p>
<p>"Well--nine sestertia to three--be it so! What! again Lydon. He
stops--he gasps for breath. By the gods, he is down! No--he is
again on his legs. Brave Lydon! Tetraides is encouraged--he laughs
loud--he rushes on him."</p>
<p>"Fool--success blinds him--he should be cautious. Lydon's eye is
like a lynx's!" said Clodius, between his teeth.</p>
<p>"Ha, Clodius! saw you that? Your man totters! Another blow--he
falls--he falls!"</p>
<p>"Earth revives him then. He is once more up; but the blood rolls
down his face."</p>
<p>"By the Thunderer! Lydon wins it. See how he presses on him!
That blow on the temple would have crushed an ox! it <i>has</i>
crushed Tetraides. He falls again--he cannot
move--<i>habet</i>!--<i>habet</i>!"</p>
<p>"<i>Habet</i>!" repeated Pansa. "Take them out and give them the
armor and swords." ...</p>
<p>While the contest in the amphitheatre had thus commenced, there
was one in the loftier benches for whom it had assumed indeed a
poignant, a stifling interest. The aged father of Lydon, despite
his Christian horror of the spectacle, in his agonized anxiety for
his son had not been able to resist being the spectator of his
fate. Once amid a fierce crowd of strangers, the lowest rabble of
the populace, the old man saw, felt nothing but the form, the
presence of his brave son! Not a sound had escaped his lips when
twice he had seen him fall to the earth; only he had turned paler,
and his limbs trembled. But he had uttered one low cry when he saw
him victorious; unconscious, alas! of the more fearful battle to
which that victory was but a prelude.</p>
<p>"My gallant boy!" said he, and wiped his eyes.</p>
<p>"Is he thy son?" said a brawny fellow to the right of the
Nazarene: "he has fought well; let us see how he does by-and-by.
Hark! he is to fight the first victor. Now, old boy, pray the gods
that that victor be neither of the Romans! nor, next to them, the
giant Niger."</p>
<p>The old man sat down again and covered his face. The fray for
the moment was indifferent to him--Lydon was not one of the
combatants. Yet, yet, the thought flashed across him--the fray was
indeed of deadly interest--the first who fell was to make way for
Lydon! He started, and bent down, with straining eyes and clasped
hands, to view the encounter.</p>
<p>The first interest was attracted toward the combat of Niger with
Sporus; for this spectacle of contest, from the fatal result which
usually attended it, and from the great science it required in
either antagonist, was always peculiarly inviting to the
spectators.</p>
<p>They stood at a considerable distance from each other. The
singular helmet which Sporus wore (the visor of which was down)
concealed his face; but the features of Niger attracted a fearful
and universal interest from their compressed and vigilant ferocity.
Thus they stood for some moments, each eying each, until Sporus
began slowly and with great caution to advance, holding his sword
pointed, like a modern fencer's, at the breast of his foe. Niger
retreated as his antagonist advanced, gathering up his net with his
right hand and never taking his small, glittering eye from the
movements of the swordsman. Suddenly, when Sporus had approached
nearly at arm's length, the retiarius threw himself forward and
cast his net. A quick inflection of body saved the gladiator from
the deadly snare; he uttered a sharp cry of joy and rage and rushed
upon Niger; but Niger had already drawn in his net, thrown it
across his shoulders, and now fled around the lists with a
swiftness which the <i>secutor</i><a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6">[6]</a> in vain endeavored to equal. The people
laughed and shouted aloud to see the ineffectual efforts of the
broad-shouldered gladiator to overtake the flying giant; when at
that moment their attention was turned from these to the two Roman
combatants.</p>
<blockquote><a name="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor6">[6]</a>
So called from the office of that tribe of gladiators in
<i>following</i> the foe the moment the net was cast, in order to
smite him ere he could have time to re-arrange it.</blockquote>
<p>They had placed themselves at the onset face to face, at the
distance of modern fencers from each other; but the extreme caution
which both evinced at first had prevented any warmth of engagement,
and allowed the spectators full leisure to interest themselves in
the battle between Sporus and his foe. But the Romans were now
heated into full and fierce encounter: they
pushed--returned--advanced on--retreated from each other, with all
that careful yet scarcely perceptible caution which characterizes
men well experienced and equally matched. But at this moment
Eumolpus, the older gladiator, by that dextrous back-stroke which
was considered in the arena so difficult to avoid, had wounded
Nepimus in the side. The people shouted; Lepidus turned pale.</p>
<p>"Ho!" said Clodius, "the game is nearly over. If Eumolpus rights
now the quiet fight, the other will gradually bleed himself
away."</p>
<p>"But, thank the gods! he does <i>not</i> fight the backward
fight. See!--he presses hard upon Nepimus. By Mars! but Nepimus had
him there! the helmet rang again!--Clodius, I shall win!"</p>
<p>"Why do I ever bet but at the dice?" groaned Clodius to
himself;--"or why cannot one cog a gladiator?"</p>
<p>"A Sporus!--a Sporus!" shouted the populace, as Niger, now
having suddenly paused, had again cast his net, and again
unsuccessfully. He had not retreated this time with sufficient
agility--the sword of Sporus had inflicted a severe wound upon his
right leg; and, incapacitated to fly, he was pressed hard by the
fierce swordsman. His great height and length of arm still
continued, however, to give him no despicable advantages; and
steadily keeping his trident at the front of his foe, he repelled
him successfully for several minutes.</p>
<p>Sporus now tried by great rapidity of evolution to get round his
antagonist, who necessarily moved with pain and slowness. In so
doing he lost his caution--he advanced too near to the
giant--raised his arm to strike, and received the three points of
the fatal spear full in his breast! He sank on his knee. In a
moment more the deadly net was cast over him,--he struggled against
its meshes in vain; again--again--again he writhed mutely beneath
the fresh strokes of the trident--his blood flowed fast through the
net and redly over the sand. He lowered his arms in acknowledgment
of defeat.</p>
<p>The conquering retiarius withdrew his net, and leaning on his
spear, looked to the audience for their judgment. Slowly, too, at
the same moment, the vanquished gladiator rolled his dim and
despairing eyes around the theatre. From row to row, from bench to
bench, there glared upon him but merciless and unpitying eyes.</p>
<p>Hushed was the roar--the murmur! The silence was dread, for in
it was no sympathy; not a hand--no, not even a woman's hand--gave
the signal of charity and life! Sporus had never been popular in
the arena; and lately the interest of the combat had been excited
on behalf of the wounded Niger. The people were warmed into
blood--the <i>mimic</i> fight had ceased to charm; the interest had
mounted up to the desire of sacrifice and the thirst of death!</p>
<p>The gladiator felt that his doom was sealed; he uttered no
prayer--no groan. The people gave the signal of death! In dogged
but agonized submission he bent his neck to receive the fatal
stroke. And now, as the spear of the retiarius was not a weapon to
inflict instant and certain death, there stalked into the arena a
grim and fatal form, brandishing a short, sharp sword, and with
features utterly concealed beneath its visor. With slow and
measured step this dismal headsman approached the gladiator, still
kneeling--laid the left hand on his humbled crest--drew the edge of
the blade across his neck--turned round to the assembly, lest, in
the last moment, remorse should come upon them; the dread signal
continued the same; the blade glittered brightly in the
air--fell--and the gladiator rolled upon the sand: his limbs
quivered--were still--he was a corpse.</p>
<p>His body was dragged at once from the arena through the gate of
death, and thrown into the gloomy den termed technically the
"spoliarium." And ere it had well reached that destination the
strife between the remaining combatants was decided. The sword of
Eumolpus had inflicted the death-wound upon the less experienced
combatant. A new victim was added to the receptacle of the
slain.</p>
<p>Throughout that mighty assembly there now ran a universal
movement; the people breathed more freely and settled themselves in
their seats. A grateful shower was cast over every row from the
concealed conduits. In cool and luxurious pleasure they talked over
the late spectacle of blood. Eumolpus removed his helmet and wiped
his brows; his close-curled hair and short beard, his noble Roman
features and bright dark eye, attracted the general admiration. He
was fresh, unwounded, unfatigued.</p>
<p>The &aelig;dile paused, and proclaimed aloud that as Niger's
wound disabled him from again entering the arena, Lydon was to be
the successor to the slaughtered Nepimus and the new combatant of
Eumolpus.</p>
<p>"Yet, Lydon," added he, "if thou wouldst decline the combat with
one so brave and tried, thou mayst have full liberty to do so.
Eumolpus is not the antagonist that was originally decreed for
thee. Thou knowest best how far thou canst cope with him. If thou
failest, thy doom is honorable death; if thou conquerest, out of my
own purse I will double the stipulated prize."</p>
<p>The people shouted applause. Lydon stood in the lists; he gazed
around; high above he beheld the pale face, the straining eyes of
his father. He turned away irresolute for a moment. No! the
conquest of the cestus was not sufficient--he had not yet won the
prize of victory--his father was still a slave!</p>
<p>"Noble &aelig;dile!" he replied, in a firm and deep tone, "I
shrink not from this combat. For the honor of Pompeii, I demand
that one trained by its long-celebrated lanista shall do battle
with this Roman."</p>
<p>The people shouted louder than before.</p>
<p>"Four to one against Lydon!" said Clodius to Lepidus.</p>
<p>"I would not take twenty to one! Why, Eumolpus is a very
Achilles, and this poor fellow is but a tyro!"</p>
<p>Eumolpus gazed hard on the face of Lydon: he smiled; yet the
smile was followed by a slight and scarce audible sigh--a touch of
compassionate emotion, which custom conquered the moment the heart
acknowledged it.</p>
<p>And now both, clad in complete armor, the sword drawn, the visor
closed, the two last combatants of the arena (ere man, at least,
was matched with beast) stood opposed to each other.</p>
<p>It was just at this time that a letter was delivered to the
pr&aelig;tor by one of the attendants of the arena; he removed the
cincture--glanced over it for a moment--his countenance betrayed
surprise and embarrassment. He re-read the letter, and then
muttering,--"Tush! it is impossible!--the man must be drunk, even
in the morning, to dream of such follies!"--threw it carelessly
aside and gravely settled himself once more in the attitude of
attention to the sports.</p>
<p>The interest of the public was wound up very high. Eumolpus had
at first won their favor; but the gallantry of Lydon, and his
well-timed allusion to the honor of the Pompeiian lanista, had
afterward given the latter the preference in their eyes.</p>
<p>"Holla, old fellow!" said Medon's neighbor to him. "Your son is
hardly matched; but never fear, the editor will not permit him to
be slain--no, nor the people neither: he has behaved too bravely
for that. Ha! that was a home thrust!--well averted by Pollux! At
him again, Lydon!--they stop to breathe! What art thou muttering,
old boy?"</p>
<p>"Prayers!" answered Medon, with a more calm and hopeful mien
than he had yet maintained.</p>
<p>"Prayers!--trifles! The time for gods to carry a man away in a
cloud is gone now. Ha! Jupiter, what a blow! Thy side--thy
side!--take care of thy side, Lydon!"</p>
<p>There was a convulsive tremor throughout the assembly. A fierce
blow from Eumolpus, full on the crest, had brought Lydon to his
knee.</p>
<p>"<i>Habet</i>!--he has it!" cried a shrill female voice; "he has
it!"</p>
<p>It was the voice of the girl who had so anxiously anticipated
the sacrifice of some criminal to the beasts.</p>
<p>"Be silent, child!" said the wife of Pansa, haughtily. "<i>Non
habet!</i>--he is <i>not</i> wounded!"</p>
<p>"I wish he were, if only to spite old surly Medon," muttered the
girl.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lydon, who had hitherto defended himself with great
skill and valor, began to give way before the vigorous assaults of
the practiced Roman; his arm grew tired, his eye dizzy, he breathed
hard and painfully. The combatants paused again for breath.</p>
<p>"Young man," said Eumolpus, in a low voice, "desist; I will
wound thee slightly--then lower thy arm; thou hast propitiated the
editor and the mob--thou wilt be honorably saved!"</p>
<p>"And my father still enslaved!" groaned Lydon to himself. "No!
death or his freedom."</p>
<p>At that thought, and seeing that, his strength not being equal
to the endurance of the Roman, everything depended on a sudden and
desperate effort, he threw himself fiercely on Eumolpus; the Roman
warily retreated--Lydon thrust again--Eumolpus drew himself
aside--the sword grazed his cuirass--Lydon's breast was
exposed--the Roman plunged his sword through the joints of the
armor, not meaning however to inflict a deep wound; Lydon, weak and
exhausted, fell forward, fell right on the point; it passed through
and through, even to the back. Eumolpus drew forth his blade; Lydon
still made an effort to regain his balance--his sword left his
grasp--he struck mechanically at the gladiator with his naked hand
and fell prostrate on the arena. With one accord, &aelig;dile and
assembly made the signal of mercy; the officers of the arena
approached, they took off the helmet of the vanquished. He still
breathed; his eyes rolled fiercely on his foe; the savageness he
had acquired in his calling glared from his gaze and lowered upon
the brow, darkened already with the shades of death; then with a
convulsive groan, with a half-start, he lifted his eyes above. They
rested not on the face of the &aelig;dile nor on the pitying brows
of the relenting judges. He saw them not; they were as if the vast
space was desolate and bare; one pale agonizing face alone was all
he recognized--one cry of a broken heart was all that, amid the
murmurs and the shouts of the populace, reached his ear. The
ferocity vanished from his brow; a soft, tender expression of
sanctifying but despairing filial love played over his
features--played--waned--darkened! His face suddenly became locked
and rigid, resuming its former fierceness. He fell upon the
earth.</p>
<p>"Look to him," said the &aelig;dile; "he has done his duty!"</p>
<p>The officers dragged him off to the spoliarium.</p>
<p>"A true type of glory, and of its fate!" murmured Arbaces to
himself; and his eye, glancing around the amphitheatre, betrayed so
much of disdain and scorn that whoever encountered it felt his
breath suddenly arrested, and his emotions frozen into one
sensation of abasement and of awe.</p>
<p>Again rich perfumes were wafted around the theatre; the
attendants sprinkled fresh sand over the arena.</p>
<p>"Bring forth the lion and Glaucus the Athenian," said the
&aelig;dile.</p>
<p>And a deep and breathless hush of overwrought interest and
intense (yet strange to say not unpleasing) terror lay like a
mighty and awful dream over the assembly.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>The door swung gratingly back--the gleam of spears shot along
the wall.</p>
<p>"Glaucus the Athenian, thy time has come," said a loud and clear
voice; "the lion awaits thee."</p>
<p>"I am ready," said the Athenian. "Brother and co-mate, one last
embrace! Bless me--and farewell!"</p>
<p>The Christian opened his arms; he clasped the young heathen to
his breast; he kissed his forehead and cheek; he sobbed aloud; his
tears flowed fast and hot over the features of his new friend.</p>
<p>"Oh! could I have converted thee, I had not wept. Oh that I
might say to thee, 'We two shall sup this night in Paradise!'"</p>
<p>"It may be so yet," answered the Greek with a tremulous voice,
"They whom death parts now may yet meet beyond the grave; on the
earth--oh! the beautiful, the beloved earth, farewell for ever!
Worthy officer, I attend you."</p>
<p>Glaucus tore himself away; and when he came forth into the air,
its breath, which though sunless was hot and arid, smote
witheringly upon him. His frame, not yet restored from the effects
of the deadly draught, shrank and trembled. The officers supported
him.</p>
<p>"Courage!" said one; "thou art young, active, well knit. They
give thee a weapon! despair not, and thou mayst yet conquer."</p>
<p>Glaucus did not reply; but ashamed of his infirmity, he made a
desperate and convulsive effort and regained the firmness of his
nerves. They anointed his body, completely naked save by a cincture
round the loins, placed the stilus (vain weapon!) in his hand, and
led him into the arena.</p>
<p>And now when the Greek saw the eyes of thousands and tens of
thousands upon him, he no longer felt that he was mortal. All
evidence of fear, all fear itself, was gone. A red and haughty
flush spread over the paleness of his features; he towered aloft to
the full of his glorious stature. In the elastic beauty of his
limbs and form; in his intent but unfrowning brow; in the high
disdain and in the indomitable soul which breathed visibly, which
spoke audibly, from his attitude, his lip, his eye,--he seemed the
very incarnation, vivid and corporeal, of the valor of his land; of
the divinity of its worship: at once a hero and a god!</p>
<p>The murmur of hatred and horror at his crime which had greeted
his entrance died into the silence of involuntary admiration and
half-compassionate respect; and with a quick and convulsive sigh,
that seemed to move the whole mass of life as if it were one body,
the gaze of the spectators turned from the Athenian to a dark
uncouth object in the centre of the arena. It was the grated den of
the lion.</p>
<p>"By Venus, how warm it is!" said Fulvia, "yet there is no sun.
Would that those stupid sailors could have fastened up that gap in
the awning!"</p>
<p>"Oh, it is warm indeed. I turn sick--I faint!" said the wife of
Pansa; even her experienced stoicism giving way at the struggle
about to take place.</p>
<p>The lion had been kept without food for twenty-four hours, and
the animal had, during the whole morning, testified a singular and
restless uneasiness, which the keeper had attributed to the pangs
of hunger. Yet its bearing seemed rather that of fear than of rage;
its roar was painful and distressed; it hung its head--snuffed the
air through the bars--then lay down--started again--and again
uttered its wild and far-resounding cries. And now in its den it
lay utterly dumb and mute, with distended nostrils forced hard
against the grating, and disturbing, with a heaving breath, the
sand below on the arena.</p>
<p>The editor's lip quivered, and his cheek grew pale; he looked
anxiously around--hesitated--delayed; the crowd became impatient.
Slowly he gave the sign; the keeper, who was behind the den,
cautiously removed the grating, and the lion leaped forth with a
mighty and glad roar of release. The keeper hastily retreated
through the grated passage leading from the arena, and left the
lord of the forest--and his prey.</p>
<p>Glaucus had bent his limbs so as to give himself the firmest
posture at the expected rush of the lion, with his small and
shining weapon raised on high, in the faint hope that <i>one</i>
well-directed thrust (for he knew that he should have time but for
<i>one</i>) might penetrate through the eye to the brain of his
grim foe.</p>
<p>But to the unutterable astonishment of all, the beast seemed not
even aware of the presence of the criminal.</p>
<p>At the first moment of its release it halted abruptly in the
arena, raised itself half on end, snuffing the upward air with
impatient signs, then suddenly it sprang forward, but not on the
Athenian. At half-speed it circled round and round the space,
turning its vast head from side to side with an anxious and
perturbed gaze, as if seeking only some avenue of escape; once or
twice it endeavored to leap up the parapet that divided it from the
audience, and on falling, uttered rather a baffled howl than its
deep-toned and kingly roar. It evinced no sign either of wrath or
hunger; its tail drooped along the sand, instead of lashing its
gaunt sides; and its eye, though it wandered at times to Glaucus,
rolled again listlessly from him. At length, as if tired of
attempting to escape, it crept with a moan into its cage, and once
more laid itself down to rest.</p>
<p>The first surprise of the assembly at the apathy of the lion
soon grew converted into resentment at its cowardice; and the
populace already merged their pity for the fate of Glaucus into
angry compassion for their own disappointment.</p>
<p>The editor called to the keeper:--"How is this? Take the goad,
prick him forth, and then close the door of the den."</p>
<p>As the keeper, with some fear but more astonishment, was
preparing to obey, a loud cry was heard at one of the entrances of
the arena; there was a confusion, a bustle--voices of remonstrance
suddenly breaking forth, and suddenly silenced at the reply. All
eyes turned in wonder at the interruption, toward the quarter of
the disturbance; the crowd gave way, and suddenly Sallust appeared
on the senatorial benches, his hair
disheveled--breathless--heated--half exhausted. He cast his eyes
hastily round the ring. "Remove the Athenian!" he cried; "haste--he
is innocent! Arrest Arbaces the Egyptian--HE is the murderer of
Ap&aelig;cides!"</p>

<p>"Art thou mad, O Sallust!" said the pr&aelig;tor, rising from
his seat. "What means this raving?"</p>
<p>"Remove the Athenian!--Quick! or his blood be on your head.
Pr&aelig;tor, delay, and you answer with your own life to the
Emperor! I bring with me the eye-witness to the death of the priest
Ap&aelig;cides. Room there, stand back, give way. People of
Pompeii, fix every eye upon Arbaces; there he sits! Room there for
the priest Calenus!"</p>
<p>Pale, haggard, fresh from the jaws of famine and of death, his
face fallen, his eyes dull as a vulture's, his broad frame gaunt as
a skeleton, Calenus was supported into the very row in which
Arbaces sat. His releasers had given him sparingly of food; but the
chief sustenance that nerved his feeble limbs was revenge!</p>
<p>"The priest Calenus--Calenus!" cried the mob. "It is he? No--it
is a dead man!"</p>
<p>"It is the priest Calenus," said the pr&aelig;tor, gravely.
"What hast thou to say?"</p>
<p>"Arbaces of Egypt is the murderer of Ap&aelig;cides, the priest
of Isis; these eyes saw him deal the blow. It is from the dungeon
into which he plunged me--it is from the darkness and horror of a
death by famine--that the gods have raised me to proclaim his
crime! Release the Athenian--<i>he</i> is innocent!"</p>
<p>"It is for this, then, that the lion spared him, A miracle! a
miracle!" cried Pansa.</p>
<p>"A miracle! a miracle!" shouted the people; "remove the
Athenian--<i>Arbaces to the lion</i>."</p>
<p>And that shout echoed from hill to vale--from coast to
sea--<i>Arbaces to the lion</i>.</p>
<p>"Officers, remove the accused Glaucus--remove, but guard him
yet," said the pr&aelig;tor. "The gods lavish their wonders upon
this day."</p>
<p>As the pr&aelig;tor gave the word of release, there was a cry of
joy: a female voice, a child's voice; and it was of joy! It rang
through the heart of the assembly with electric force; it was
touching, it was holy, that child's voice. And the populace echoed
it back with sympathizing congratulation.</p>
<p>"Silence!" said the grave pr&aelig;tor; "who is there?"</p>
<p>"The blind girl--Nydia," answered Sallust; "it is her hand that
has raised Calenus from the grave, and delivered Glaucus from the
lion."</p>
<p>"Of this hereafter," said the pr&aelig;tor. "Calenus, priest of
Isis, thou accusest Arbaces of the murder of Ap&aelig;cides?"</p>
<p>"I do!"</p>
<p>"Thou didst behold the deed?"</p>
<p>"Pr&aelig;tor--with these eyes--"</p>
<p>"Enough at present--the details must be reserved for more
suiting time and place. Arbaces of Egypt, thou hearest the charge
against thee--thou hast not yet spoken--what hast thou to say?"</p>
<p>The gaze of the crowd had been long riveted on Arbaces; but not
until the confusion which he had betrayed at the first charge of
Sallust and the entrance of Calenus had subsided. At the shout,
"Arbaces to the lion!" he had indeed trembled, and the dark bronze
of his cheek had taken a paler hue. But he had soon recovered his
haughtiness and self-control. Proudly he returned the angry glare
of the countless eyes around him; and replying now to the question
of the pr&aelig;tor, he said, in that accent so peculiarly tranquil
and commanding which characterized his tones:--</p>
<p>"Pr&aelig;tor, this charge is so mad that it scarcely deserves
reply. My first accuser is the noble Sallust--the most intimate
friend of Glaucus! My second is a priest: I revere his garb and
calling--but, people of Pompeii! ye know somewhat of the character
of Calenus--he is griping and gold-thirsty to a proverb; the
witness of such men is to be bought! Pr&aelig;tor, I am
innocent!"</p>
<p>"Sallust," said the magistrate, "where found you Calenus?"</p>
<p>"In the dungeons of Arbaces."</p>
<p>"Egyptian," said the pr&aelig;tor, frowning, "thou didst, then,
dare to imprison a priest of the gods--and wherefore?"</p>

<br>
<p>"Hear me," answered Arbaces, rising calmly, but with agitation
visible in his face. "This man came to threaten that he would make
against me the charge he has now made, unless I would purchase his
silence with half my fortune; I remonstrated--in vain. Peace
there--let not the priest interrupt me! Noble pr&aelig;tor--and ye,
O people! I was a stranger in the land--I knew myself innocent of
crime--but the witness of a priest against me might yet destroy me.
In my perplexity I decoyed him to the cell whence he has been
released, on pretense that it was the coffer-house of my gold. I
resolved to detain him there until the fate of the true criminal
was sealed and his threats could avail no longer; but I meant no
worse. I may have erred--but who among ye will not acknowledge the
equity of self-preservation? Were I guilty, why was the witness of
this priest silent at the trial?--<i>then</i> I had not detained or
concealed him. Why did he not proclaim my guilt when I proclaimed
that of Glaucus? Pr&aelig;tor, this needs an answer. For the rest,
I throw myself on your laws. I demand their protection. Remove
hence the accused and the accuser. I will willingly meet, and
cheerfully abide by the decision of, the legitimate tribunal. This
is no place for further parley."</p>
<p>"He says right." said the pr&aelig;tor. "Ho! guards--remove
Arbaces--guard Calenus! Sallust, we hold you responsible for your
accusation. Let the sports be resumed."</p>
<p>"What!" cried Calenus, turning round to the people, "shall Isis
be thus contemned? Shall the blood of Ap&aelig;cides yet cry for
vengeance? Shall justice be delayed now, that it may be frustrated
hereafter? Shall the lion be cheated of his lawful prey? A god! a
god!--I feel the god rush to my lips! <i>To the lion--to the lion
with Arbaces</i>!"</p>
<p>His exhausted frame could support no longer the ferocious malice
of the priest; he sank on the ground in strong convulsions; the
foam gathered to his mouth; he was as a man, indeed, whom a
supernatural power had entered! The people saw, and shuddered.</p>
<p>"It is a god that inspires the holy man! <i>To the lion with the
Egyptian</i>!"</p>
<p>With that cry up sprang, on moved, thousands upon thousands.
They rushed from the heights; they poured down in the direction of
the Egyptian. In vain did the &aelig;dile command; in vain did the
pr&aelig;tor lift his voice and proclaim the law. The people had
been already rendered savage by the exhibition of blood; they
thirsted for more; their superstition was aided by their ferocity.
Aroused, inflamed by the spectacle of their victims, they forgot
the authority of their rulers. It was one of those dread popular
convulsions common to crowds wholly ignorant, half free and half
servile, and which the peculiar constitution of the Roman provinces
so frequently exhibited. The power of the pr&aelig;tor was a reed
beneath the whirlwind; still, at his word the guards had drawn
themselves along the lower benches, on which the upper classes sat
separate from the vulgar. They made but a feeble barrier; the waves
of the human sea halted for a moment, to enable Arbaces to count
the exact moment of his doom! In despair, and in a terror which
beat down even pride, he glanced his eye over the rolling and
rushing crowd; when, right above them, through the wide chasm which
had been left in the velaria, he beheld a strange and awful
apparition; he beheld, and his craft restored his courage!</p>
<p>He stretched his hand on high; over his lofty brow and royal
features there came an expression, of unutterable solemnity and
command.</p>
<p>"Behold!" he shouted with a voice of thunder, which stilled the
roar of the crowd: "behold how the gods protect the guiltless! The
fires of the avenging Orcus burst forth against the false witness
of my accusers!"</p>
<p>The eyes of the crowd followed the gesture of the Egyptian, and
beheld with dismay a vast vapor shooting from the summit of
Vesuvius in the form of a gigantic pine-tree; the trunk,
blackness--the branches fire!--a fire that shifted and wavered in
its hues with every moment, now fiercely luminous, now of a dull
and dying red, that again blazed terrifically forth with
intolerable glare!</p>
<p>There was a dead, heart-sunken silence; through which there
suddenly broke the roar of the lion, which was echoed back from
within the building by the sharper and fiercer yells of its
fellow-beast. Dread seers were they of the Burden of the
Atmosphere, and wild prophets of the wrath to come!</p>
<p>Then there arose on high the universal shrieks of women; the men
stared at each other, but were dumb. At that moment they felt the
earth shake under their feet; the walls of the theatre trembled;
and beyond in the distance they heard the crash of falling roofs;
an instant more, and the mountain cloud seemed to roll toward them,
dark and rapid, like a torrent; at the same time it cast forth from
its bosom a shower of ashes mixed with vast fragments of burning
stone! over the crushing vines, over the desolate streets, over the
amphitheatre itself; far and wide, with many a mighty splash in the
agitated sea, fell that awful shower!</p>
<p>No longer thought the crowd of justice or of Arbaces; safety for
themselves was their sole thought. Each turned to fly--each
dashing, pressing, crushing against the other. Trampling recklessly
over the fallen, amid groans and oaths and prayers and sudden
shrieks, the enormous crowd vomited itself forth through the
numerous passages. Whither should they fly? Some, anticipating a
second earthquake, hastened to their homes to load themselves with
their more costly goods and escape while it was yet time; others,
dreading the showers of ashes that now fell fast, torrent upon
torrent, over the streets, rushed under the roofs of the nearest
houses, or temples, or sheds--shelter of any kind--for protection
from the terrors of the open air. But darker, and larger, and
mightier, spread the cloud above them. It was a sudden and more
ghastly Night rushing upon the realm of Noon!</p>

<h3>KENELM AND LILY</h3>
<center>From 'Kenelm Chillingly'</center>
<br>
<p>The children have come,--some thirty of them, pretty as English
children generally are, happy in the joy of the summer sunshine,
and the flower lawns, and the feast under cover of an awning
suspended between chestnut-trees and carpeted with sward.</p>
<p>No doubt Kenelm held his own at the banquet, and did his best to
increase the general gayety, for whenever he spoke the children
listened eagerly, and when he had done they laughed mirthfully.</p>
<p>"The fair face I promised you," whispered Mrs. Braefield, "is
not here yet. I have a little note from the young lady to say that
Mrs. Cameron does not feel very well this morning, but hopes to
recover sufficiently to come later in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"And pray who is Mrs. Cameron?"</p>
<p>"Ah! I forgot that you are a stranger to the place. Mrs. Cameron
is the aunt with whom Lily resides. Is it not a pretty name,
Lily?"</p>
<p>"Very! emblematic of a spinster that does not spin, with a white
head and a thin stalk."</p>
<p>"Then the name belies my Lily; as you will see."</p>
<p>The children now finished their feast and betook themselves to
dancing, in an alley smoothed for a croquet-ground and to the sound
of a violin played by the old grandfather of one of the party.
While Mrs. Braefield was busying herself with forming the dance,
Kenelm seized the occasion to escape from a young nymph of the age
of twelve, who had sat next to him at the banquet and taken so
great a fancy to him that he began to fear she would vow never to
forsake his side,--and stole away undetected.</p>
<p>There are times when the mirth of others only saddens us,
especially the mirth of children with high spirits, that jar on our
own quiet mood. Gliding through a dense shrubbery, in which, though
the lilacs were faded, the laburnum still retained here and there
the waning gold of its clusters, Kenelm came into a recess which
bounded his steps and invited him to repose. It was a circle, so
formed artificially by slight trellises, to which clung parasite
roses heavy with leaves and flowers. In the midst played a tiny
fountain with a silvery murmuring sound; at the background,
dominating the place, rose the crests of stately trees, on which
the sunlight shimmered, but which rampired out all horizon beyond.
Even as in life do the great dominant passions--love, ambition,
desire of power, or gold, or fame, or knowledge--form the proud
background to the brief-lived flowerets of our youth, lift our eyes
beyond the smile of their bloom, catch the glint of a loftier
sunbeam, and yet--and yet--exclude our sight from the lengths and
the widths of the space which extends behind and beyond them.</p>
<p>Kenelm threw himself on the turf beside the fountain. From afar
came the whoop and the laugh of the children in their sports or
their dance. At the distance their joy did not sadden him--he
marveled why; and thus, in musing reverie, thought to explain the
why to himself.</p>
<p>"The poet," so ran his lazy thinking, "has told us that
'distance lends enchantment to the view,' and thus compares to the
charm of distance the illusion of hope. But the poet narrows the
scope of his own illustration. Distance lends enchantment to the
ear as well as to the sight; nor to these bodily senses alone.
Memory, no less than hope, owes its charm to 'the far away.'</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine myself again a child when I am in the midst of
yon noisy children. But as their noise reaches me here, subdued and
mellowed; and knowing, thank Heaven! that the urchins are not
within reach of me, I could readily dream myself back into
childhood and into sympathy with the lost playfields of school.</p>
<p>"So surely it must be with grief: how different the terrible
agony for a beloved one just gone from earth, to the soft regret
for one who disappeared into heaven years ago! So with the art of
poetry: how imperatively, when it deals with the great emotions of
tragedy, it must remove the actors from us, in proportion as the
emotions are to elevate, and the tragedy is to please us by the
tears it draws! Imagine our shock if a poet were to place on the
stage some wise gentleman with whom we dined yesterday, and who was
discovered to have killed his father and married his mother. But
when Oedipus commits those unhappy mistakes nobody is shocked.
Oxford in the nineteenth century is a long way off from Thebes
three thousand or four thousand years ago.</p>
<p>"And," continued Kenelm, plunging deeper into the maze of
metaphysical criticism, "even where the poet deals with persons and
things close upon our daily sight--if he would give them poetic
charm he must resort to a sort of moral or psychological distance;
the nearer they are to us in external circumstance, the farther
they must be in some internal peculiarities. Werter and Clarissa
Harlowe are described as contemporaries of their artistic creation,
and with the minutest details of an apparent realism; yet they are
at once removed from our daily lives by their idiosyncrasies and
their fates. We know that while Werter and Clarissa are so near to
us in much that we sympathize with them as friends and kinsfolk,
they are yet as much remote from us in the poetic and idealized
side of their natures as if they belonged to the age of Homer; and
this it is that invests with charm the very pain which their fate
inflicts on us. Thus, I suppose, it must be in love. If the love we
feel is to have the glamor of poetry, it must be love for some one
morally at a distance from our ordinary habitual selves; in short,
differing from us in attributes which, however near we draw to the
possessor, we can never approach, never blend, in attributes of our
own; so that there is something in the loved one that always
remains an ideal--a mystery--'a sun-bright summit mingling with the
sky!'" ...</p>
<p>From this state, half comatose, half unconscious, Kenelm was
roused slowly, reluctantly. Something struck softly on his
cheek--again a little less softly; he opened his eyes--they fell
first upon two tiny rosebuds, which, on striking his face, had
fallen on his breast; and then looking up, he saw before him, in an
opening of the trellised circle, a female child's laughing face.
Her hand was still uplifted, charged with another rosebud; but
behind the child's figure, looking over her shoulder and holding
back the menacing arm, was a face as innocent but lovelier far--the
face of a girl in her first youth, framed round with the blossoms
that festooned the trellis. How the face became the flowers! It
seemed the fairy spirit of them.</p>
<p>Kenelm started and rose to his feet. The child, the one whom he
had so ungallantly escaped from, ran towards him through a wicket
in the circle. Her companion disappeared.</p>
<p>"Is it you?" said Kenelm to the child--"you who pelted me so
cruelly? Ungrateful creature! Did I not give you the best
strawberries in the dish, and all my own cream?"</p>
<p>"But why did you run away and hide yourself when you ought to be
dancing with me?" replied the young lady, evading, with the
instinct of her sex, all answer to the reproach she had
deserved.</p>
<p>"I did not run away; and it is clear that I did not mean to hide
myself, since you so easily found me out. But who was the young
lady with you? I suspect she pelted me too, for <i>she</i> seems to
have run away to hide herself."</p>
<p>"No, she did not pelt you; she wanted to stop me, and you would
have had another rosebud--oh, so much bigger!--if she had not held
back my arm. Don't you know her--don't you know Lily?"</p>
<p>"No; so that is Lily? You shall introduce me to her."</p>
<p>By this time they had passed out of the circle through the
little wicket opposite the path by which Kenelm had entered, and
opening at once on the lawn. Here at some distance the children
were grouped; some reclined on the grass, some walking to and fro,
in the interval of the dance....</p>
<p>Before he had reached the place, Mrs. Braefield met him.</p>
<p>"Lily is come!"</p>
<p>"I know it--I have seen her."</p>
<p>"Is not she beautiful?"</p>
<p>"I must see more of her if I am to answer critically; but before
you introduce me, may I be permitted to ask who and what is
Lily?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Braefield paused a moment before she answered, and yet the
answer was brief enough not to need much consideration She is a
Miss Mordaunt, an orphan; and as I before told you, resides with
her aunt, Mrs. Cameron, a widow. They have the prettiest cottage
you ever saw on the banks of the river, or rather rivulet, about a
mile from this place. Mrs. Cameron is a very good, simple-hearted
woman. As to Lily, I can praise her beauty only with safe
conscience, for as yet she is a mere child--her mind quite
unformed."</p>
<p>"Did you ever meet any man, much less any woman, whose mind was
formed?" muttered Kenelm. "I am sure mine is not, and never will be
on this earth."</p>
<p>Mrs. Braefield did not hear this low-voiced observation. She was
looking about for Lily; and perceiving her at last as the children
who surrounded her were dispersing to renew the dance, she took
Kenelm's arm, led him to the young lady, and a formal introduction
took place.</p>
<p>Formal as it could be on those sunlit swards, amidst the joy of
summer and the laugh of children. In such scene and such
circumstance, formality does not last long. I know not how it was,
but in a very few minutes Kenelm and Lily had ceased to be
strangers to each other. They found themselves seated apart from
the rest of the merry-makers, on the bank shadowed by lime-trees;
the man listening with downcast eyes, the girl with mobile shifting
glances, now on earth, now on heaven, and talking freely,
gayly--like the babble of a happy stream, with a silvery dulcet
voice and a sparkle of rippling smiles.</p>
<p>No doubt this is a reversal of the formalities of well-bred life
and conventional narrating thereof. According to them, no doubt, it
is for the man to talk and the maid to listen; but I state the
facts as they were, honestly. And Lily knew no more of the
formalities of drawing-room life than a skylark fresh from its nest
knows of the song-teacher and the cage. She was still so much of a
child. Mrs. Braefield was right--her mind was still so
unformed.</p>
<p>What she did talk about in that first talk between them that
could make the meditative Kenelm listen so mutely, so intently, I
know not; at least I could not jot it down on paper. I fear it was
very egotistical, as the talk of children generally is--about
herself and her aunt and her home and her friends--all her friends
seemed children like herself, though younger--Clemmy the chief of
them. Clemmy was the one who had taken a fancy to Kenelm. And
amidst all the ingenuous prattle there came flashes of a quick
intellect, a lively fancy--nay, even a poetry of expression or of
sentiment. It might be the talk of a child, but certainly not of a
silly child.</p>
<p>But as soon as the dance was over, the little ones again
gathered round Lily. Evidently she was the prime favorite of them
all; and as her companions had now become tired of dancing, new
sports were proposed, and Lily was carried off to "Prisoner's
Base."</p>
<p>"I am very happy to make your acquaintance, Mr. Chillingly,"
said a frank, pleasant voice; and a well-dressed, good-looking man
held out his hand to Kenelm.</p>
<p>"My husband," said Mrs. Braefield with a certain pride in her
look.</p>
<p>Kenelm responded cordially to the civilities of the master of
the house, who had just returned from his city office, and left all
its cares behind him. You had only to look at him to see that he
was prosperous and deserved to be so. There were in his countenance
the signs of strong sense, of good-humor--above all, of an active,
energetic temperament. A man of broad smooth forehead, keen hazel
eyes, firm lips and jaw; with a happy contentment in himself, his
house, the world in general, mantling over his genial smile, and
outspoken in the metallic ring of his voice.</p>
<p>"You will stay and dine with us, of course," said Mr. Braefield;
"and unless you want very much to be in town to-night, I hope you
will take a bed here."</p>
<p>Kenelm hesitated.</p>
<p>"Do stay at least till to-morrow," said Mrs. Braefield. Kenelm
hesitated still; and while hesitating, his eyes rested on Lily,
leaning on the arm of a middle-aged lady, and approaching the
hostess--evidently to take leave.</p>
<p>"I cannot resist so tempting an invitation," said Kenelm, and he
fell back a little behind Lily and her companion.</p>
<p>"Thank you much for so pleasant a day," said Mrs. Cameron to the
hostess. "Lily has enjoyed herself extremely. I only regret we
could not come earlier."</p>
<p>"If you are walking home," said Mr. Braefield, "let me accompany
you. I want to speak to your gardener about his heart's-ease--it is
much finer than mine."</p>
<p>"If so," said Kenelm to Lily, "may I come too? Of all flowers
that grow, heart's-ease is the one I most prize."</p>
<p>A few minutes afterward Kenelm was walking by the side of Lily
along the banks of a little stream tributary to the Thames; Mrs.
Cameron and Mr. Braefield in advance, for the path only held two
abreast.</p>
<p>Suddenly Lily left his side, allured by a rare butterfly--I
think it is called the Emperor of Morocco--that was sunning its
yellow wings upon a group of wild reeds. She succeeded in capturing
this wanderer in her straw hat, over which she drew her sun-veil.
After this notable capture she returned demurely to Kenelm's
side.</p>
<p>"Do you collect insects?" said that philosopher, as much
surprised as it was his nature to be at anything.</p>
<p>"Only butterflies," answered Lily; "they are not insects, you
know; they are souls."</p>
<p>"Emblems of souls, you mean--at least so the Greeks prettily
represented them to be."</p>
<p>"No, real souls--the souls of infants that die in their cradles
unbaptized; and if they are taken care of, and not eaten by birds,
and live a year, then they pass into fairies."</p>
<p>"It is a very poetical idea, Miss Mordaunt, and founded on
evidence quite as rational as other assertions of the metamorphosis
of one creature into another. Perhaps you can do what the
philosophers cannot--tell me how you learned a new idea to be an
incontestable fact?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Lily, looking very much puzzled:
"perhaps I learned it in a book, or perhaps I dreamed it."</p>
<p>"You could not make a wiser answer if you were a philosopher.
But you talk of taking care of butterflies: how do you do that? Do
you impale them on pins stuck into a glass case?"</p>
<p>"Impale them! How can you talk so cruelly? You deserve to be
pinched by the fairies."</p>
<p>"I am afraid," thought Kenelm, compassionately, "that my
companion has no mind to be formed; what is euphoniously called 'an
innocent.'"</p>
<p>He shook his head and remained silent.</p>
<p>Lily resumed--"I will show you my collection when we get
home--they seem so happy. I am sure there are some of them who know
me--they will feed from my hand. I have only had one die since I
began to collect them last summer."</p>
<p>"Then you have kept them a year; they ought to have turned into
fairies."</p>
<p>"I suppose many of them have. Of course I let out all those that
had been with me twelve months--they don't turn to fairies in the
cage, you know. Now I have only those I caught this year, or last
autumn; the prettiest don't appear till the autumn."</p>
<p>The girl here bent her uncovered head over the straw hat, her
tresses shadowing it, and uttered loving words to the prisoner.
Then again she looked up and around her, and abruptly stopped and
exclaimed:--</p>
<p>"How can people live in towns--how can people say they are ever
dull in the country? Look," she continued, gravely and
earnestly--"look at that tall pine-tree, with its long branch
sweeping over the water; see how, as the breeze catches it, it
changes its shadow, and how the shadow changes the play of the
sunlight on the brook:--</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Wave your tops, ye pines;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With every plant, in sign of worship
wave.'<br>
<p>What an interchange of music there must be between Nature and a
poet!"</p>
<p>Kenelm was startled. This "an innocent!"--this a girl who had no
mind to be formed! In that presence he could not be cynical; could
not speak of Nature as a mechanism, a lying humbug, as he had done
to the man poet. He replied gravely:--</p>
<p>"The Creator has gifted the whole universe with language, but
few are the hearts that can interpret it. Happy those to whom it is
no foreign tongue, acquired imperfectly with care and pain, but
rather a native language, learned unconsciously from the lips of
the great mother. To them the butterfly's wing may well buoy into
heaven a fairy's soul!"</p>
<p>When he had thus said, Lily turned, and for the first time
attentively looked into his dark soft eyes; then instinctively she
laid her light hand on his arm, and said in a low voice, "Talk
on--talk thus; I like to hear you."</p>
<p>But Kenelm did not talk on. They had now arrived at the
garden-gate of Mrs. Cameron's cottage, and the elder persons in
advance paused at the gate and walked with them to the house.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
